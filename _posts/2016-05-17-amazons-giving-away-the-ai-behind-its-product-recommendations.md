No? Well, you’ll soon be able to it anyway.</p>
<p>Taco Bell has blessed the world with TacoBot, a chatbot for the popular workplace chat app Slack. Tell TacoBot what you want, and it keeps a running tally of your order, just like that screen at the drive-thru. When you’re done, pay through TacoBot and pick up your order at the Nearest Participating Taco Bell.</p>
<p>If that sounds like it would be handy for your team—or, you know, your “team”—you can <a href="https://www.tacobell.com/feed/tacobot">join the waiting list</a>. Be warned, though—it might be a few months before you revel in the miracle of this advance in productivity tech, says Martin Legowiecki. He’s the creative technology director at <a href="http://www.deutsch.com/">Deutsch</a>, the agency that built TacoBot. And even after you’re in, you’ll still have to send someone with the Taco Bell app on their phone to fetch the order. So, much like the <a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/03/qa-with-tacocopter/">Tacocopter</a> before it, the <em>real</em> bot-ified future of meat, cheese, and tortilla still hasn’t arrived.</p>
<p>But fear not: Legowiecki says delivery is something Taco Bell is working on, too.</p>
<h3>Really Slacking</h3>
<p>TacoBot is one of the most gluttonous manifestations yet of the bot-powered future of work that many companies predict. In China, <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/06/future-ui-design-old-school-text-messages/">people already use the popular instant message app WeChat</a> for all sorts of daily tasks, from checking their bank balances to ordering cabs to buying sneakers. Silicon Valley entrepreneurs are betting that chatbots will replace apps here in the US, too.</p>
<p>Slack, with competitors like Hipchat, hope this chat revolution won’t just change consumer behavior but the way work gets done at corporations with lots of money to spend on office supplies, company lunches, and whatever else big companies spend their budgets on. Slack is taking this so seriously that last year it <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/12/slack-is-investing-80-million-in-slack-bot-startups/">said</a> that it would invest $80 million in companies that build Slack bots.</p>
<p>That vision of the future aside, TacoBot came about almost by accident. Deutsch was contracted by Taco Bell to redesign the company’s website, Legowiecki says. During the course of that project, the Taco Bell and Deutsch teams worked together using Slack. “They fell in love with it, we fell in love with it,” Legowiecki says. “So we though wouldn’t it be great to make Taco Bell available through Slack?”</p>
<p>The Deutsch team built TacoBot using <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/10/wit-ai/">Wit.ai</a>, an online service for building software that’s able understand and respond to human language. (Facebook bought Wit.ai last year to help build its <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/08/how-facebook-m-works/">virtual assistant M</a>.) Legowiecki says this means it will be able to bring TacoBot to other apps in the future, such as Hipchat, Facebook Messenger, Amazon Echo, even Apple TV.</p>
<p>In other words, food bots are coming, whether you want them or not. As if you need another excuse to hit the drive-thru.</p>
