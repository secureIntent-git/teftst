        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"I was moving forward and this tape really sabotaged me," he said.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Attorneys for Gawker, which could be financially ruined by a loss, claim that it was Hogan who made his sex life a public matter. On Tuesday they presented him with clips from interviews and excerpts from his reality TV show, for which he was filmed on a toilet, and comments he had made about the size of his penis.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Hogan emphasized the difference between his private character and the bombastic persona he used professionally with "artistic liberty."</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>He acknowledged embellishing the number of women he slept with and his penis description and realized that he shed his anonymity in public. But in his house, or in a trusted friend's private bedroom, Hogan told the court: "Nobody invades my privacy."</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Over two days of testimony, Hogan has described how he ended up having consensual sex with the wife of his then-best friend, radio "shock jock" Bubba the Love Sponge, in Bubba's home.
