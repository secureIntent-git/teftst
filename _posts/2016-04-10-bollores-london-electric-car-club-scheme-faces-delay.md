We must admit that the discussion, negotiations are going well but are taking a bit more time than we thought," Bollore told Reuters.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"Probably we will be one year or two years behind but what we will achieve will be what we have planned to achieve." </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Bollore's Blue Solutions division has previously said it was aiming to put 3,000 electric cars on London's streets by 2018 but agreement needed on the infrastructure has pushed that back.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Dealing with the capital's local authorities, which control issues such as street maintenance and parking, and are run by different political parties, has been a problem for others trying to set up carpooling schemes.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Bollore said it had been easier to set up its electric carsharing scheme in other cities such as Paris where the mayor has more power to push boroughs to introduce key infrastructure.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
