Police and SWAT teams rushed to the scene.</p><p>"They don't let nobody in or out," he said. "The SWAT team is inside there."</p><p>Authorities have conducted a controlled explosion near the nightclub,  according to Orlando police. </p><p>Tom Fuentes, a CNN law enforcement analyst, said controlled explosions are used to breach a door or when a subject is barricaded in a room and police want to use a stun grenade to temporarily freeze their central nervous system. </p><p>FBI agents were also assisting at the scene, agency spokeswoman Amy Pittman said. President Barack Obama was briefed on the shooting and asked the FBI and other federal officials to provide him with regular updates, a statement said. </p><p>Florida Gov.
