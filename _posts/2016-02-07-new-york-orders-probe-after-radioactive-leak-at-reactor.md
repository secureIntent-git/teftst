        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Entergy in a statement said the tritium likely reached the ground at Indian Point during recent work at the site. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>"While elevated tritium in the ground onsite is not in accordance with our standards, there is no health or safety consequence to the public, and releases are more than a thousand times below federal permissible limits,"Â the company said. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Cuomo, in his letter ordering the state investigation, said Indian Point has previously had a problem with the release of radioactive water, and this time the levels of radioactivity reported by the company are worse than in past incidents.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>One monitoring well showed a nearly 65,000 percent spike in radioactivity, from 12,300 picocuries per liter to more than 8 million picocuries per liter, the governor said.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>On May 9, 2015, a unit at the Indian Point nuclear plant was shut down following a transformer failure and fire, in an incident that sent smoke spewing from the plant.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
