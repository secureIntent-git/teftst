	Alton Sterling’s 15-year-old son gave a composed, mature speech begging the public to come together “as one united family” — just a week after his father was killed by Louisiana cops</p>      <p>&#13;
	“You can protest, but I want everyone to protest the right way,” Cameron Sterling said at a Wednesday press conference outside the Baton Rouge convenience store where his father was fatally shot last week. “With peace. No violence — none whatsoever.”</p>      <p>&#13;
	The teen’s poised plea came a week after his <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/alton-sterling-son-weeps-police-shooting-death-article-1.2701054" target="_blank">first emotional public appearance</a>, just hours after his father was killed. The heartbroken boy broke down in tears and hid his face with his shirt as his mother spoke about Alton Sterling’s shooting death.</p>      <p>&#13;
	“I truly feel that my father was a good man, and he will always be a good man,” the collected Cameron Sterling said Wednesday morning.</p>    <p> <a class="ra-related" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/baton-rouge-cops-bust-plot-kill-cops-stolen-guns-article-1.2708954">Baton Rouge cops bust plot to kill cops using stolen guns</a> </p>        <p>&#13;
	He added: “I feel that people in general should come together as one united family,”</p>      <p>&#13;
	Alton Sterling was selling music in front of a Baton Rouge convenience store last week when he was shot and killed by police officers. The cops reported to the shop just after midnight on July 5 after a homeless man called 911 and said Sterling was carrying a gun.</p>      <p>&#13;
	Video of the shooting and its aftermath showed the father’s hands were empty when he was killed. One of the officers pulled an object from his pocket as they searched his body — likely a gun.</p>      <p>&#13;
	Cameron Sterling’s request for peace comes days after a gunman <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/officers-dead-shot-protest-downtown-dallas-article-1.2703354" target="_blank">killed five police officers at a Thursday Dallas protest. </a></p>    <p> <a class="ra-related" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/alton-sterling-wake-funeral-held-southern-university-article-1.2708427">Alton Sterling's wake, funeral to be held at Southern University</a> </p>                            <div class="ra-module h" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemid="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Alton-Sterling039s-son-pleads-for-peace-amid-tense-protests-New-York-Daily-News.jpg">  <figure class="ra-figure"><span class="ra-enlarge"/>        <img srcset="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Alton-Sterling039s-son-pleads-for-peace-amid-tense-protests-New-York-Daily-News.jpg 750w, http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2700892.1467807121!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_1200/profile7n-1-web.jpg 1200w" alt="Alton Sterling, 37, was shot and killed by police in Baton Rouge on July 5.&#xA0;" src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Alton-Sterling039s-son-pleads-for-peace-amid-tense-protests-New-York-Daily-News.jpg"/><figcaption><h2 class="ra-caption" itemprop="description">Alton Sterling, 37, was shot and killed by police in Baton Rouge on July 5. </h2>    <span class="ra-credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Facebook)</span>   </figcaption></figure></div>             <p>&#13;
	The peaceful demonstration — organized in response to Alton Sterling’s death and the shooting of another black man in Minnesota — turned chaotic when shooter Micah Johnson opened fire on the cops protecting the march.</p>      <p>&#13;
	Johnson, 25, wounded another nine people before he was killed by a police bomb robot during a tense standoff in a parking garage. During negotiations before the blast, the gunman <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/dallas-shooter-killed-cops-wanted-kill-chief-article-1.2704049" target="_blank">claimed he was targeting white cops </a>and was furious over the two recent police killings.</p>      <p>&#13;
	Cameron Sterling isn’t the only child at the center of the dual police killings.</p>      <p>&#13;
	In Minnesota, <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/man-shot-dead-minn-police-traffic-stop-article-1.2701935" target="_blank">Philando Castile was fatally shot</a> during a traffic stop in front of his girlfriend and her 4-year-old daughter — a tot who immediately began comforting her sobbing mother.</p>        <p>&#13;
	“It’s OK, I’m right here with you,” the little girl told Diamond Reynolds just minutes after the Wednesday night killing. Reynolds began live-streaming the aftermath of the shooting, catching her daughter’s comforting words on video.</p>      <p>&#13;
	Castile was not the girl’s biological dad, but he raised her as his own, Reynolds said.</p>       <p>&#13;
	“My daughter will forever be scarred by what the police of Falcon Heights did to us,” <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/philando-castile-girlfriend-rails-cops-live-video-article-1.2702435" target="_blank">Reynolds said a day after the killing</a>, adding that her girl is a “warrior” and an “angel.”</p>
