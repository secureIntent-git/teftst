Porter testified at his own trial that he told Goodson that Gray had asked for medical help. Porter’s trial ended in a hung jury. He’s awaiting retrial.</p> <p>The trial judge has ordered Porter to testify against Goodson despite Porter’s assertion that he has a right not to incriminate himself.</p> <p>On Monday, Goodson’s trial was suspended until the matter is resolved.</p> <p>Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.
