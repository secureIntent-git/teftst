					<p>The oceans have been acting weird lately. While some sea creatures have boomed (octopuses), others have busted (humpback whales), and yet others literally melted into goo (starfish). Whether the causes are <a href="http://www.wired.com/tag/el-nino/" target="_blank">El Niño</a> or the “<a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/12/el-nino-and-the-blob/" target="_blank">Blob</a>” or ultimately <a href="http://www.wired.com/tag/climate-change/" target="_blank">climate change</a>, these events point to just how interconnected and poorly understood the ocean ecosystem is—how little of it observable by humans. A marine biologist who studies whales once likened finding a beached one to finding a specimen of a “space alien.” The sea is dark and full of mysteries.</p>

				<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/11/whales-wind-turbines/" target="_blank">Humpback whales</a> in the Pacific like to winter in the south, near, say, the warm waters of Hawai’i. But this year, surveys in Hawai’i have turned up less a third of the number of humpback whales as in 2010, when the last survey was conducted. In addition, fewer of the pods had calves with them either. Whale experts don’t know why this year has been so strange, though some suspect that shifting ocean temperatures due to the strong El Niño may play a part.</p>
