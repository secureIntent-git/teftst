        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>“This was the first time that any group had issued seasonal forecasts for the Atlantic,” Klotzbach said. “He consistently issued these forecasts for over 30 years, a track record unparalleled for university predictions.”</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>A Detroit native, Gray grew up in Washington D.C. and graduated from George Washington University in 1952.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force in 1953, where he spent four years as a weather forecaster, mostly in England and the Azores.
