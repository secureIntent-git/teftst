                <p><span class="dateline">MOBILE, Ala. –  </span>An Alabama teacher is on leave after giving middle school students a test with math questions about prostitutes, drugs and guns, a school official said Wednesday.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>Rena Philips, a spokeswoman for Mobile County's public schools, said the educator from Burns Middle School was placed on administrative leave after a parent complained. The teacher's name isn't being made public, Phillips said.</p>

                <p>"My son, he took a picture of it in class and he texted it to me. I couldn't believe it," Hall said.</p>

            <p>Question: Leroy has 2 ounces of cocaine. If he sells an eight ball to Antonio for $320 and 2 grams to Juan for $85 per gram, what is the street value of the rest of his hold?</p>

                <p>Hall said students thought the quiz was a joke, but the teacher "told them that it wasn't it a joke, and they had to complete it and turn it in."</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>The 10-question quiz included questions about prostitution, drugs, drive-by shootings and spray paint graffiti. According to WALA, one of the questions was: Leroy has 2 ounces of cocaine. If he sells an eight ball to Antonio for $320 and 2 grams to Juan for $85 per gram, what is the street value of the rest of his hold?"</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>It was similar to a math quiz that's been on the internet for years with questions about gangs.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>Philips said the principal and a school police officer investigated after officials learned of the test Tuesday, and the teacher was placed on leave.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>Hall said the teacher is retiring at the end of the school year, but Philips declined comment on details of her job status.   </p>
