      <p>An 18-year-old man with a rifle opened fire outside of a high school prom in northern Wisconsin, wounding two students before a police officer who was in the parking lot fired on the attacker, "stopping the threat," authorities said. The unidentified gunman later died, according to a coroner.</p><p> The attack happened late Saturday outside the Antigo High School prom, said Eric Roller, the chief of police in Antigo, a community of about 8,000 people roughly 150 miles north of Milwaukee.</p>
  <p> Roller said in a news release that the students who were wounded were shot as they exited the building, though he didn't say if investigators believe those students were specifically targeted.</p><p> "Officers were in the parking lot patrolling the activities and heard the shots and an officer immediately fired upon the shooter, stopping the threat," he said.</p><span class="trb_ar_cont" data-ar-cont="Article continues below"/>
    
            <p> Roller said those students and a third injured person — possibly the attacker, but he didn't specify — were taken to a hospital and that investigators don't believe there is a further threat to the community.</p><p> The statement didn't include the identities or sexes of the wounded students or the assailant, and it didn't specify the nature of the assailant's injuries or a possible motive. Roller didn't respond to repeated requests for further information left on his voicemail Sunday.</p><p> After the attack, students were escorted from the prom to safety and the victims' families were notified.</p><p><em>Associated Press</em></p></div>
