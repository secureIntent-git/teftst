"He fought for the memory of the six million Jews who perished in the Holocaust, and he fought for Israel. He waged countless battles for innocent victims regardless of ethnicity or creed."</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Wiesel, 87, died on Saturday at his home in New York City.

But those who knew him in private life had the pleasure of experiencing a gentle and devout man who was always interested in others, and whose quiet voice moved them to better themselves," he said in a statement. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>"I will hear that voice for the rest of my life, and hope and pray that I will continue to earn the unconditional love and trust he always showed me," he said.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>While the Romanian-born Wiesel was best known for his campaign never to let the world forget the Holocaust, one of his greatest rewards was working with students, including those at Boston University, where he was a religion and philosophy professor.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
