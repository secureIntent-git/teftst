<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="7"><p><span class="articleLocation">BOULDER, Colo.</span> A Colorado woman convicted of attempted murder for stabbing a pregnant stranger and cutting her fetus from her womb, after luring the victim with a online adÂ for free maternity clothes, was due to be sentenced on Friday.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>A Boulder County District Court judge was scheduled to hand down the sentence for Dynel Lane, 35, for the 2015 attack on Michelle Wilkins in the town of Longmont, about 30 miles (48 km)north of Denver.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The grisly assault case drew widespread attention because it  renewed a national debate over whether a fetus is a person and whether termination of a pregnancy can ever be considered murder.  </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Wilkins, who was seven months pregnant, survived the attack, but her unborn baby died. A coroner concluded that the fetus did not take a breath outside the womb, so under Colorado law, Lane could not be charged with murder.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Wilkins, 27, testified at trial that she went to Lane's home after seeing a Craigslist ad for maternity and baby clothes. After talking for about an hour, she said Lane bludgeoned her, slashed her with shards of glass from a lava lamp, pummeled her with her fists, and choked her into unconsciousness.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>She then cut out the fetus with kitchen knives, according to trial testimony.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Lane's court-appointed lawyers argued at the February trial that Lane did not plan the attack in advance. But prosecutors said her assault on Wilkins was part of a premeditated plot to steal a baby and convince her husband it was theirs, after faking her own pregnancy.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Jurors deliberated for about eight hours before convicting Lane of attempted murder, four counts of felony assault and unlawful termination of a pregnancy following the four-day trial.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Prosecutors argued for consecutive sentences, calling the attack "exceptionally cruel and vicious," according to a sentencing statement.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><span id="midArticle_10"/><p> (Reporting by Keith Coffman in Boulder, Colorado; Editing by Curtis Skinner and Tom Brown)</p><span id="midArticle_11"/></div>
