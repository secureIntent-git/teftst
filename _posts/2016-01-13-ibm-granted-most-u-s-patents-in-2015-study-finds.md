IBM gained 7,355 patents last year. Utility patents cover function rather than design.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Among the technology giants notable for their intellectual property, Alphabet Inc's (<span id="symbol_GOOGL.O_1">GOOGL.O</span>) Google stepped up its patent activity, moving to the fifth position from eighth in 2014, while Apple Inc (<span id="symbol_AAPL.O_2">AAPL.O</span>) stayed at the 11th position.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Patents are sometimes the subject of legal battles, and investors, analysts and enthusiasts alike track patents closely to see what companies are looking to develop next.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Following IBM, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (<span id="symbol_005930.KS_3">005930.KS</span>) and Canon Inc (<span id="symbol_7751.T_4">7751.T</span>) rounded off the top three spots, the ranking showed.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>

        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Companies such as Microsoft and Panasonic (<span id="symbol_6752.T_6">6752.T</span>)  have assigned some patents to newly formed holding companies, which explains why several entities dropped considerably lower in the rankings, IFI said.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>"Rather than keeping all corporate patents under a single registration, some companies are choosing to spread their portfolios across multiple entities," said Larry Cady, an analyst at IFI Claims.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
