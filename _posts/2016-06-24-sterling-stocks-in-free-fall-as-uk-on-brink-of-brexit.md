The euro in turn slid 3.4 percent to $1.0997 <a href="http://www.reuters.com/finance/currencies/quote?srcCurr=EUR&amp;destCurr=USD">EUR=</a> as investors feared for its very future.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>While vote counting had not been concluded, major British television networks including ITV, the BBC and Sky News all called the result as a "Leave" and betting firm BetFair estimated the probability of leaving as high as 94 percent.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Sterling sank a staggering 9 percent to $1.3525 <a href="http://www.reuters.com/finance/currencies/quote?srcCurr=GBP&amp;destCurr=USD">GBP=</a>, having carved out a range of $1.3462 to $1.5022. The fall was even larger than during the global financial crisis and the currency was moving two or three cents in the blink of an eye.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>"The carnage in the FX markets may continue if the leave votes pull further ahead in the lead," said Bernard Aw, markets strategist at IG in Singapore. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>"Equities markets will be affected, and we can see that Asian stocks are already under a fair bit of pressure.

        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The safe-haven yen sprang higher to stand at 101.52 per dollar <a href="http://www.reuters.com/finance/currencies/quote?srcCurr=JPY&amp;destCurr=USD">JPY=</a>, having been as low as 106.81 at one stage. The dollar decline of 4 percent was the largest since 1998.  </p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>That dragged the Nikkei <a href="http://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=jp%21n225">.N225</a> down more than 8 percent and prompted warnings from Japanese officials that excessive forex moves were undesirable. Indeed, traders were wary in case global central banks chose to step in to calm the volatility.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Other currencies across Asia suffered badly on worries that alarmed investors could pull funds out of emerging markets.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS slid almost 5 percent, while Shanghai stocks <a href="http://www.reuters.com/finance/markets/index?symbol=cn%21SHI">.SSEC</a> lost 1.1 percent.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><span id="midArticle_15"/>

An Ipsos MORI poll put the lead at 8 points while a YouGov poll out just after polls closed found 52 percent of respondents said they voted to remain in the EU.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Sovereign bonds came back into favor as safe harbors against extreme market volatility, with U.S. 10-year Treasury futures TYc1 jumping 1.29 points.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Yields on the cash note US10YT=RR fell 21 basis points to 1.53 percent, the steepest one day drop since 2009.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>The rally did not extend to UK bonds, however, as ratings agency Standard and Poor's has warned it would likely downgrade the country's triple A rating if it left the EU.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Yields on 10-year gilts were indicated up 20 basis points at around 1.57 percent GB10YT=TWEB, meaning higher borrowing costs for a government already struggling with a large budget deficit.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Across the Atlantic, investors were pricing in even less chance of another hike in U.S. interest rates given the Federal Reserve had cited a British exit from the EU as one reason to be cautious on tightening.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>"It adds weight to the camp that the Fed would be on hold. A July (hike) is definitely off the table," Mike Baele, managing director with the private client reserve group at U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Fed funds futures &lt;0#FF:&gt; were even toying with the chance that the next move would be a cut in U.S. rates.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Commodities likewise swung lower as a Brexit would be seen as a major threat to global growth.
