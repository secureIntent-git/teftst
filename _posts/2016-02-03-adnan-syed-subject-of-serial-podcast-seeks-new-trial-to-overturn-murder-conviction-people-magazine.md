		 </div><div id="articleBody" readability="89.883670831538">Adnan Syed, whose conviction in the 1999 murder of a former high school girlfriend spawned the true crime podcast <em>Serial</em>, returns to court today in Baltimore as his defense team argues for a new trial.
<p>In November, a Baltimore judge granted a request by Syed, 35, to introduce new evidence in the case of the murder of his ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee. The podcast followed reporter Sarah Koenig investigation into Lee's death and Syed's trial and raised doubts about his guilt.&#13;
</p><p>The hearing will focus on a potential new alibi witness for Syed and a reexamination of cellphone evidence.&#13;
</p><p>The witness is Asia McClain, a classmate of Syed's, who has said <a href="http://www.people.com/article/serial-podcast-adnan-syed-legal-victory" target="_blank">she saw Syed in the library</a> at the alleged time of the killing. She was not called as a witness at trial, and she stated in an affidavit that an assistant state's attorney discouraged her from attending Syed's post-conviction hearings.&#13;
</p><p><!-- insert ssi-->Syed's lawyers claim that his lawyer at trial, Christina Gutierrez, who is now deceased, never contacted McClain. &#13;
</p><p>Syed's lawyers will also challenge cell phone evidence used at trial, which was used to show he was in the vicinity of the park in which Lee's body was found. <a href="http://www.people.com/article/adnan-syed-requests-new-trial-serial" target="_blank">In a brief requesting a new trial</a>, Syed's lawyers say that the data should have been inadmissible because it only tracked outgoing calls and not incoming. &#13;
</p><p>Syed's lawyers claim Gutierrez never alerted the court to a fax cover sheet from AT&amp;T stating: "Outgoing calls only are reliable for location status. Any incoming calls will NOT be considered reliable information for location." &#13;
</p><p>"The errors committed by trial counsel were of such a fundamental nature that Syed must be given a new trial," Syed's lawyers wrote in their brief.&#13;

</p><p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2015/01/07/prosecutor-serial-case-goes-record/" target="_blank">In an interview with <em>The Intercept</em> last year</a>, prosecutor <a href="http://www.people.com/article/prosecutor-speaks-on-npr-serial-case" target="_blank">Kevin Urick</a>, who declined to be interviewed for the podcast, said, "The case itself I would say was pretty much a run-of-the-mill domestic violence murder."&#13;
</p><p>Syed has steadfastly maintained his innocence of the murder. He is serving a life sentence. </p></div>
