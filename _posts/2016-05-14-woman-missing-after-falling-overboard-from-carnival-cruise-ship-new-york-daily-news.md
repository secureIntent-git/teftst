	The U.S. Coast guard is frantically searching for a Texas mother-of-four whose mysterious plunge from a Carnival cruise ship was caught on video early Friday.</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	Authorities are searching for 33-year-old Samantha Broberg, who was captured on surveillance footage falling from the ocean liner into the Gulf of Mexico, about 195 miles from the coast of Galveston, Tex.</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	The woman’s travel companions had also reported her missing, according to <a href="http://abc13.com/news/cruise-ship-passenger-goes-overboard-in-gulf/1337990/" target="_blank">ABC News</a>.</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	Broberg, an Arlington, Texas native, is a stay-at-home mother to four children, according to <a href="http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Cost-Guard-searching-for-woman-missing-from-7468058.php" target="_blank">the Houston Chronicle</a>. </p>                                                                           <div class="ra-module h" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemid="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Woman-missing-after-falling-overboard-from-Carnival-cruise-ship-New-York-Daily-News.jpg">

	"We are shocked and deeply saddened by the incident that occurred on the Carnival Cruise Ship. We hope and pray the U.S. Coast Guard is able to bring Samantha home. We ask for privacy as our family comes together during this difficult time," a statement from Broberg's family read.</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	The Carnival Liberty cruise ship had taken off from Galveston Thursday for a four-day Mexico vacation. Broberg had been on the trip with a group, according to Carnival. </p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	"Carnival’s CareTeam is providing support to the guests traveling companions and family. We are keeping our guests and her loved ones in our thoughts during this difficult time,” the statement added.</p>                                                                           <div class="ra-module v" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemid="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1463244310_123_Woman-missing-after-falling-overboard-from-Carnival-cruise-ship-New-York-Daily-News.jpg">

	Cruise passenger Linda Lopez told <a href="http://abc13.com/news/cruise-ship-passenger-goes-overboard-in-gulf/1337990/" target="_blank">KTRK News</a> that tensions are high on the luxury liner. </p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	“They wanted to check every single room to make sure that every guest was in their room. They were just keeping us updated like ‘we have not found her,” Lopez said. </p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	“People are talking about it everywhere. They’re very sad.”</p>                                                          <a href="mailto:voicers@nydailynews.com?subject=Texas woman missing after falling overboard from Carnival cruise&amp;body=To%20submit%20a%20comment%20about%20this%20article%20for%20publication%20in%20the%20Daily%20News%20Voice%20of%20the%20People%20column,%20please%20include%20your%20name,%20your%20city%20and%20state%20and%20your%20phone%20number.%20(Please%20include%20your%20borough%20or%20neighborhood%20if%20you%20live%20in%20NYC.%20Phone%20number%20is%20for%20verification%20purposes%20only,%20not%20for%20publication.)%20The%20Daily%20News%20reserves%20the%20right%20to%20edit%20letters. %0A%0A http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/woman-missing-falling-overboard-carnival-cruise-ship-article-1.2636914" class="ra-editor">Send a Letter to the Editor</a>      <dl id="ra-tags"><dt>Tags:</dt>  <dd> <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/tags/missing-persons">missing persons</a> </dd>  <dd> <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/tags/texas">texas</a> </dd>  </dl><dl id="ra-share-bottom"><dt>Join the Conversation:</dt> <dd class="ra-share-f"> <a target="_blank" href="#">facebook</a> </dd> <dd class="ra-share-t"> <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Ford, Spielberg reteaming for fifth 'Indiana Jones' movie&amp;url=http://nydn.us/1M5ngYs">twitter</a> </dd> </dl></div>
