<p><strong>CHICAGO (CBS) —</strong> Faced with excruciatingly long lines at security checkpoints, the TSA is dispatching 58 new security officers and four bomb-sniffing canine teams to O’Hare International Airport, according to U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin.</p>
<p>The move comes as officials at the Chicago Department of Aviation advised anyone flying out of O’Hare or Midway International Airport to show up three hours before their flight’s scheduled departure time. That’s even longer than the two-hour cushion the TSA has suggested for domestic flights, although the TSA recommends arriving three hours early for international flights.</p>
<p>At 6 a.m. Tuesday, the Chicago Department of Aviation sent out messages on its Twitter accounts for O’Hare and Midway, advising travelers about unusually long lines for security.</p>


<p>In a statement released later Tuesday, Durbin said he has spoken to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson about the massive delays at Chicago’s airports, and was assured the TSA is moving quickly to train and hire more officers. He also said the TSA will immediately send 58 new security officers and four additional bomb-sniffing canine teams to O’Hare, which is routinely one of the three busiest airports in the U.S.</p>
<p>“As summer approaches, the number of people traveling increases dramatically—that means long lines at airport security checkpoints. Protecting the safety of passengers remains priority number one, but poor planning and inadequate funding have led to huge lines and unreasonable delays at airports in Chicago and across the country. We need more security officers and more screening lines open and running to bring down wait times,” Durbin said.</p>
<p>The TSA has announced plans to hire nearly 800 new officers and pay for more part-time workers and overtime, in an effort to address worsening wait times at airport security checkpoints. The agency has said the increasingly long lines at airports are the result of a combination of increased traveler volumes and TSA staffing shortages due to federal budget cuts.</p>
<p>The union that represents TSA officers has said the agency needs to hire 6,000 employees to fully staff security lines.</p>
<p>Over the past several days, many passengers have said they missed their flights in Chicago, even after following the TSA’s recommendations to show up two hours early for a domestic flight, because they’ve had to wait up to three hours in line for security. American Airlines said 4,000 passengers have missed flights at O’Hare since February due to the security lines.</p>
<p>Durbin said if more travelers sign up for the TSA’s Pre-Check program, it would help ease the burden at security checkpoints, and reduce wait times.</p>
<p>“I pressed Secretary Johnson to improve and expedite the enrollment process for that program. Airlines must also encourage more travelers to check bags instead of hauling them through the main security lines, and I’ll be calling on them to waive their checked baggage fees during these peak travel months,” Durbin said.</p>
<p>The PreCheck program requires travelers to undergo an in-person interview and fingerprinting, and allows them to receive expedited screening – no removing shoes, belts, or jackets; liquids and laptops can stay in their bags; and no full-body scans are required, just standard metal detectors.</p>
<p>The fee for the PreCheck program is $85, but once a traveler gets their “known traveler number,” it is valid for five years. </p>
<p>Most major carriers participate but airlines such as Spirit Airlines and Frontier Airlines have yet to upgrade their computer systems to allow PreCheck. Here are the airlines currently participating: Allegiant Airlines, Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, OneJet, Southwest Airlines, Sun Country, United Airlines, Virgin America and WestJet.</p>
