The media company's publisher and CEO, Nick Denton, was slapped with an additional $10 million.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>"I think we made history today, because I think we protected a lot of people today who may be going through what I went through," Hogan told reporters Monday on the steps outside the courthouse. "So we're very excited, very happy."</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Hogan sued the website for posting a video clip in 2012 featuring him having sex with the wife of his then-best friend, the radio shock jock Bubba the Love Sponge Clem.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The editor responsible for the post, A.J.

        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>On Friday, after a two-week trial in St. Petersburg, near Hogan's home, the jury found that Gawker had violated Hogan's right to privacy and awarded the longtime World Wrestling Entertainment star $60 million for emotional distress and $55 million for economic damages.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Gawker plans to appeal the decision in a civil case that has drawn wide interest for testing boundaries between a celebrity's privacy rights and press liberties in the digital age.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Legal experts say the company stands a good chance of getting the decision pared back or reversed on appeal.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>"There is so much this jury deserved to know and, fortunately, that the appeals court does indeed know.
