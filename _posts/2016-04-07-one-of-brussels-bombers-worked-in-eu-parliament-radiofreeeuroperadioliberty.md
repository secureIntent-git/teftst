		<p>One of the men who carried out the deadly attacks in Brussels on March 22 had worked as a cleaner in the European Parliament six years earlier. </p>

<p>In a statement on April 6, the EU Parliament said the individual had month-long summer jobs there in 2009 and 2010. </p>

<p>Although the EU Parliament did not reveal his name, sources identified him as Najim Laachraoui, a 25-year-old Belgian who prosecutors said blew himself up in the airport attack and is also suspected of making suicide vests for last November's Paris attacks in which 130 people died.</p>

<p>The Belgian prime minister defended his country's approach to fighting terror threats, insisting Belgium is not a "failed state."</p>

<p>Charles Michel said authorities had to take a share of the blame for failings before and after March 22, when attacks claimed by the Islamic State militant group killed 32 people. </p>
