<p itemprop="articleBody">
The U.N. special envoy for Syria is heading to Moscow ahead of the planned resumption of indirect peace talks between the Russia-backed government of Syrian President Bashar Assad and opposition groups next week in Geneva.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
Staffan de Mistura's office says he was to meet on Tuesday with Russian Foreign Minister <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/sergey-lavrov.htm" class="r_lapi">Sergey Lavrov</a> to discuss the next round of the talks.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
The so-called "proximity talks" between Assad's envoys and representatives of the opposition adjourned last month, after nearly two weeks during which de Mistura shuttled between the delegations.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
The talks achieved no significant breakthroughs. U.N.-designated terror groups such as the Islamic State and al-Qaida's branch in Syria, known as the Nusra Front, are not involved in the talks or the cease-fire.</p>

Syrian activist groups are reporting that militants have shot down a warplane in northern Syria.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says it isn't clear whether the warplane that was downed on Tuesday is Russian or Syrian.</p>
