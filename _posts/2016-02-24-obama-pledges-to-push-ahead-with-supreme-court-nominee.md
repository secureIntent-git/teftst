<span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">WASHINGTON</span> U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday vowed to move ahead with a Supreme Court justice nominee despite defiance from Senate Republicans, saying he will pick someone with an "independent mind" who understands how laws affect people’s lives.</p></span><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>In a guest post on the independent scotusblog.com, Obama outlined the top qualities he is looking for in a replacement for Justice Antonin Scalia, who died earlier this month. Obama gave no timeline for making his selection.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>He said his choice "will be eminently qualified" and have a mastery of the law to give clear answers to complicated legal questions. Additionally, "the person I appoint will be someone who recognizes the limits of the judiciary’s role; who understands that a judge’s job is to interpret the law, not make the law," he said.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Obama said he also wants a nominee who has the life experience to understand that law is not abstract legal theory but "affects the daily reality of people’s lives in a big, complicated democracy, and in rapidly changing times."</p><span id="midArticle_3"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The Senate must confirm any nominee from Obama, a Democrat, but Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has vowed not to allow the chamber to consider any nominee during the president's last year in office.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The death of Scalia, a conservative stalwart, left the court with an 4-4 ideological split as it moves to complete the remainder of its term. The court still could have open seat when its next session starts in October.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Obama, who has placed two justices on the high court bench during his seven years in office, wrote that he would "fulfill my constitutional duty to appoint a judge to our highest court" and urged the Republican-led Senate to also fulfill its responsibilities under the U.S. Constitution. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>"I hope they’ll move quickly to debate and then confirm this nominee so that the court can continue to serve the American people at full strength," he wrote.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><span id="midArticle_8"/><p> (Reporting by Susan Heavey; Editing by Eric Walsh and Bill Trott)</p><span id="midArticle_9"/></div>
