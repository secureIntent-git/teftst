<br><div id=""><p>Olympus’s latest ruggedized camera is an odd duck. Actually, it’s more like a platypus—a crazy mashup of ideas that somehow works. Let’s start with the name: The Stylus Tough TG-Tracker. That sounds like something you’d name a pickup, which is fitting, because this thing is about as tough as a truck.</p>
<p>If you’re the type of person who can use a harpoon gun, drinks large quantities of Red Bull, or owns a pair of crampons, this is the camera for your go-bag. Olympus designed it to be a go-anywhere, shoot-anything action camera. It’s like a <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/5160452334/ricoh-introduces-lightweight-wg-m2-rugged-action-cam-with-4k-capture" target="_blank">Ricoh WG-M2</a> with better onboard instruments.</p>
<p>Beyond the name and optional green accents, the weirdness continues with a lens mounted on the side. It’s right under a light that puts out 60 lumens for a full minute and 30 lumens for 30 minutes—great for underwater photography or catching your midnight run down the mountain. The lens placement, combined with a 1.5-inch LCD screen that flips open and a pistol-grip attachment, make this rig well suited to capturing video of your extreme adventures. Think of it as a small camcorder with solid specs.</p>
<p>How solid? The pocketable TG-Tracker records 4K video at 30fps and 720p video at up to 120fps. For stills, a modest 8-megapixel resolution maintains reasonable pixel density on the 1/2.3-inch CMOS sensor. The 14mm/F2.0 lens captures an insane 204-degree field of view, which means the optics are wide enough to see a bit <em>behind</em> you. Finally, a camera that lets you capture Trent flipping you off in sharp detail after you’ve zipped past him on your dogsled.</p>
<p>Those are exactly the sorts of things Olympus imagines people shooting, so it protected the TG-Tracker with a freezeproof/waterproof/drop-proof frame and packed it with sensors galore. GPS, a compass, a barometer, an accelerometer, and a temperature gauge are all covered. You can use them all as standalone instruments, or pull off cool tricks like start recording once you’ve hit a specific speed or altitude. The camera ties all that data to your clips, and Olympus’s mobile app lets you navigate your footage on a map interface.</p>
<p>As good as it is on land, the TG-Tracker should be even more useful underwater. You can take it down 100 feet without a problem, and all those sensors tell the camera when it’s submerged. Olympus says the TG automatically adjusts the white-balance and exposure underwater, and it’ll keep foreground and background objects visible even when the headlight is on. Just don’t expect it to capture that shark sneaking up behind you: The field of view drops to 94 degrees when you’re underwater, and to 84 degrees if you’re using the 5-axis digital camera stabilization.</p>
<p>If this sounds like a great rig for your next adventure, you’ll be psyched to know that it should be here in time for summer vacation. The TG-Tracker ships next month for $350. That price includes a pistol grip, an underwater lens protector, and a selfie-mirror so you can shred El Colorado on a monoski while chugging Mountain Dew and post the evidence to Insta.</p>
