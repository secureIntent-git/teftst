<p itemprop="articleBody">
A <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/chicago.htm" class="r_lapi">Chicago</a> man who police say shot a 9-year-old boy in the head after he was lured from a playground to be killed because of his father's gang ties has been charged with first-degree murder.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
Dwight Boone-Doty, 22, was charged Monday night in the Nov. 2 death of Tyshawn Lee. Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Boone-Doty has been held since his November arrest on unrelated gun charges.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
It wasn't immediately clear if Boone-Doty has an attorney who can comment on his behalf. Neither the Cook County State's Attorney's office nor the public defender's office immediately responded to phone messages seeking that information.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
Police say Tyshawn was targeted because of his father's gang affiliation and a recent series of shootings between two rival gangs, the Gangster Disciples and the Black P Stones, in the Auburn Gresham neighborhood on Chicago's South Side.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
Authorities believe three men were involved in Tyshawn's killing.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
Boone-Doty is accused of pulling the trigger and Corey Morgan, 27, who was charged with murder in November, is accused of luring the fourth-grader from a nearby park and into the alley where he was shot. Morgan has denied any involvement.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
Police are searching for a third suspect who is believed to be hiding in <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/iowa.htm" class="r_lapi">Iowa</a>, according to U.S. Marshals.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
Investigators believe the boy was killed in retaliation for the Oct. 13 gang killing of Tracey Morgan, Corey Morgan's 25-year-old brother.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
Boone-Doty also is charged with murder in the Oct. 18 shooting death of 19-year-old Brianna Jenkins and attempted murder and aggravated battery in the wounding of Deshari Bowens, according to the state's attorney's office. Bowens, a 20-year-old man who is affiliated with a gang, was sitting in a car with Jenkins when she was killed.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
Boone-Doty was paroled from the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/illinois.htm" class="r_lapi">Illinois</a> Department of Corrections in August after serving about two years on a five-year sentence in a drug case.</p>
