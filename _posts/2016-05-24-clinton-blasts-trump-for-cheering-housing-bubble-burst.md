<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="6"><p><span class="articleLocation">WASHINGTON</span> Democrat Hillary Clinton, seeking to dampen Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's growing appeal with working-class voters, on Tuesday accused him of having cheered on the 2008 housing market crash.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Clinton's campaign released an ad with audio the presumptive Republican nominee had recorded in 2006 for his now-defunct Trump University venture. Trump, a billionaire real estate developer, said of a "bubble burst" that "I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy" property and "make a lot of money."</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Clinton's campaign and her surrogates have seized on the recording to argue that she would take better care of the U.S. economy. She is seeking to blunt the inroads that Trump has been making with voters in crucial states such as Florida and Ohio.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Opinion polls in key states show Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, and Trump are in a tight race ahead of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. Nationally, Trump has been rising in polls to pull roughly even with Clinton.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Clinton surrogates from Ohio and Florida held a conference call with reporters about Trump's statements. Her campaign also hosted related events in Virginia, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Iowa, Colorado and Nevada, which will all be battlegrounds in November's general election.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>"How could Trump possibly champion the collapse of the housing market and our economy?" U.S. Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio said on the call.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>In Ohio, the 2008 recession led to 394,000 families losing their homes, housing values declined 16 percent and 411,000 people lost jobs, Ryan said.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>In Florida, 1.5 million lost homes and more than 800,000 lost jobs, Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn said on the call, characterizing the state as "ground zero" of the housing crisis.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Representative Dina Titus, a Democratic congresswoman from Nevada, said on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday that Trump should stay out of the state's housing market, which was one of the hardest hit in the country.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>"The crash of the housing market devastated my hometown of Las Vegas," Titus said.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Clinton, meanwhile, is still fighting on two fronts as she seeks to wrap up her primary battle with Democratic rival Bernie Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Clinton and Sanders both campaigned on Tuesday in California, which is among six states holding Democratic nominating contests on June 7. California has more Democratic delegates than any other state, and Sanders has invested heavily there.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Clinton needs to win California for a strong finish heading into her party's national convention in July and to dispel questions about whether she can unite the party after a drawn-out, increasingly bitter primary race.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Clinton on Monday turned down an invitation by Fox News to debate Sanders in California despite having agreed previously to a May debate. Her campaign said Clinton's time would be better spent meeting directly with California voters.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>Sanders took Clinton to task, saying her refusal was an insult to California voters. In a television ad released by his campaign on Tuesday that will run ahead of California's primary, Sanders says the state is a "long way to Washington" but voters can "send them a message they can't ignore."</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>Sanders on Tuesday also requested that the state of Kentucky review his loss there last week to Clinton by fewer than 2,000 votes. Kentucky's secretary of state, Alison Grimes, said in a statement that they will recanvass the results at all 120 county boards of election.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><span id="midArticle_2"/><p> (Additional reporting by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)</p><span id="midArticle_3"/></div>
