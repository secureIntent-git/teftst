Jordan's King Abdullah was to be among the dignitaries at the sports arena for the service, but Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who attended a Muslim funeral for Ali on Thursday, cut short his visit to Louisville and will not take part in Friday's event.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Crystal could reprise parts of his routine called "15 Rounds," a tribute to the three-time heavyweight boxing champion that the comedian first delivered in 1979. In it, Crystal tells Ali's story through a masterful impersonation of the champ and the late sportscaster Howard Cosell, who was an important early defender of Ali during his most controversial days.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Pallbearers will include actor Will Smith, who earned an Oscar nomination for playing the title role in the 2001 film "Ali," and former heavyweight champ Lennox Lewis.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>"Now as the world continues to flow into our city, it's time for us to send him off tomorrow with great class and dignity and respect," Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said at a news conference on Thursday. "The world will literally be watching tomorrow as Muhammad's processional and memorial service are broadcast to a global audience."</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The mayor encouraged people to throw flowers and bring "smiles and maybe a tear or two as well."</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The procession will pass by Ali's boyhood home on the West End, traditionally an African-American section of town, and the Muhammad Ali Center, a museum in the center of the mid-sized city, which is also home to the Kentucky Derby.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>On Thursday, the Muslim funeral for Ali drew thousands of mourners who prayed over the body of a man who battled in the ring and sought peace outside it.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Speakers referred to him as "the people's champ" who was praised for advancing the cause of black Americans during and after the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Others admired him for making Islam more acceptable and giving U.S. Muslims a hero they could share with mainstream America.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Turkish officials did not say why Erdogan returned home. The CNN Turk news outlet reported he had wanted to lay a piece of cloth on Ali's coffin and wanted the head of Turkey's religious affairs directorate to recite part of the Koran but had been refused.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><span id="midArticle_12"/><p> (Reporting by Steve Bittenbender; Writing by Daniel Trotta; Editing by Toni Reinhold and Bill Trott)</p><span id="midArticle_13"/></div>
