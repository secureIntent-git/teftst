One East Side shelter, he said, was "infested with mice, burrowing in our food bags" and another was "notorious for criminals and people robbing each other's cellphones, robbing each other's clothes, robbing each other's food."</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:apcm="http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm" xmlns:apnm="http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm" xmlns:o="http://w3.org/ns/odrl/2/">He instead opts to sleep on the steps of a <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/search/?action=search&amp;channel=news%2Fus&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=gsa&amp;query=%22Park+Avenue+church%22">Park Avenue church</a>, fortified every few hours with a $2.18 cup of hot soup from a nearby Subway sandwich shop. Hamarics said he hadn't noticed any changes since the two outreach initiatives began.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:apcm="http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm" xmlns:apnm="http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm" xmlns:o="http://w3.org/ns/odrl/2/">"The exact same people are still in the exact same place," said Hamarics, who identified himself as a skilled carpenter looking for a job.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:apcm="http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm" xmlns:apnm="http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm" xmlns:o="http://w3.org/ns/odrl/2/">Three of the people interviewed said they had been approached by police officers in recent weeks, but only in the way long familiar to New Yorkers: ordering them off public spaces and suggesting they go to shelters, without offering any assistance or direction.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:apcm="http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm" xmlns:apnm="http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm" xmlns:o="http://w3.org/ns/odrl/2/">A de Blasio spokeswoman noted that the stepped-up outreach effort had begun but, due to training requirements, wouldn't be running at full capacity until March. "It takes multiple outreach efforts to build trust with individuals living on the streets," spokeswoman <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/search/?action=search&amp;channel=news%2Fus&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=gsa&amp;query=%22Ishanee+Parikh%22">Ishanee Parikh</a> said.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:apcm="http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm" xmlns:apnm="http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm" xmlns:o="http://w3.org/ns/odrl/2/">There are many reasons that some homeless people might choose to avoid a shelter. Drugs and drinking aren't allowed, and the facilities are sometimes full of difficult, troubled people in close quarters.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:apcm="http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm" xmlns:apnm="http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm" xmlns:o="http://w3.org/ns/odrl/2/">Comptroller <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/search/?action=search&amp;channel=news%2Fus&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=gsa&amp;query=%22Scott+Stringer%22">Scott Stringer</a>, saying he's "horrified," released an audit finding more than 18,000 health or safety violations — including vermin infestation, busted smoke detectors and peeling lead paint — at the city's 500 shelters. Reports of violent incidents against shelter staff and residents have also increased by 55 percent, from 504 in the fiscal year 2012 to 783 in the fiscal year 2015, according to city records.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:apcm="http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm" xmlns:apnm="http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm" xmlns:o="http://w3.org/ns/odrl/2/">De Blasio, whose agenda has been dominated by a need to address the city's homelessness crisis, has announced a plan to step up repairs to city shelters, acknowledging that "for decades our shelters have not been safe enough or clean enough, and that's just not acceptable." But most of the homeless people interviewed last month were skeptical that the city was following through on its plan and doubted the problem could ever be solved.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:apcm="http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm" xmlns:apnm="http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm" xmlns:o="http://w3.org/ns/odrl/2/">"Same problem, but it got bigger: more homeless, all over the place," said <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/search/?action=search&amp;channel=news%2Fus&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=gsa&amp;query=%22Michael+Williams%22">Michael Williams</a>, 50, saying he once worked as a messenger at the <a href="http://www.seattlepi.com/search/?action=search&amp;channel=news%2Fus&amp;inlineLink=1&amp;searchindex=gsa&amp;query=%22World+Trade+Center%22">World Trade Center</a> and has been homeless for 14 years. "I haven't noticed anything different. It doesn't matter; it's the same thing, the same thing. Nothing's changed. They're not doing nothing."</p>
