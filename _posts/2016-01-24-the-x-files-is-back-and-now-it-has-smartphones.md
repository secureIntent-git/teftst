<br><div id="start-of-content"><p>Everyone’s got a favorite <em>X-Files</em> episode; which is yours? The one with Eugene Tooms, the flexible cannibal? The one with Flukeman? That time Mulder and Scully got trapped in the house with those three crazy-ass brothers? The <em>Rashomon</em>-like one about the vampires? Regardless of whether you loved the long-arc alien cover-up conspiracy, the monsters of the week, or the funnier episodes, chances are you’re excited about the show’s return this Sunday. The first of six all-new episodes airs after the NFC Championship game—and while it takes a little while for the series to find its rhythm, it’s always great to see everyone’s favorite FBI agents truth-hunting again.</p>
