Diane Tran, 47, was sentenced to four years in prison. She pleaded guilty in January to voluntary manslaughter.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Esparza, who moved to Europe after the murder and later became an assistant professor at Webster University in Geneva, pleaded guilty in 2014 to voluntary manslaughter and agreed to testify against others accused in the killing.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Chief among them was her former boyfriend, Gianni Anthony Van, now 46, who was found guilty in May 2015 of first-degree murder and was sentenced two months later to life in prison without the possibility of parole.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>According to prosecutors, Ramirez was abducted, tied up and hacked to death with a meat cleaver by Van and others at Esparza's behest in retaliation for her claim that he had raped her weeks earlier.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Prosecutors have raised doubts about the veracity of her rape accusation, noting during Van's trial that Esparza did not report the alleged sexual assault to authorities until after learning Ramirez had made romantic overtures to her sister.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Yet another suspect in the case, Diane Tran's husband Kody Tran, died in a shootout with police in 2012 before charges were filed in the Ramirez killing.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
