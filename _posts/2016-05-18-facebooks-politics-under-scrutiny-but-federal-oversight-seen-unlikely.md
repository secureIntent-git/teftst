The allegations were reported by technology news website Gizmodo, which did not identify the ex-contractor.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Facebook denied the allegations of bias and said it would conduct a full investigation into the matter. Zuckerberg also agreed to meet with conservative leaders to "share their points of view," according to a post on his Facebook page.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Attendees at the Wednesday afternoon meeting at Facebook's Silicon Valley headquarters are expected to include conservative talk show host Glenn Beck, former White House press secretary Dana Perino and former Republican Senator Jim DeMint.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Thune sent a letter to Facebook last week to demand that it explain its editorial decision-making and how stories are chosen for the "trending topics" feature. He said his primary concern was that Facebook was potentially being deceptive about how the news curation algorithms work. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>The company was criticized in 2014 for secretly manipulating what content appeared for a sample of users to research the psychological effects of social media.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Facebook last week released its guidelines for choosing trending topics, but the operations of the news feed algorithm remain closely guarded.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Thune said Facebook has been in communication with his staff in the week since he wrote the letter.
