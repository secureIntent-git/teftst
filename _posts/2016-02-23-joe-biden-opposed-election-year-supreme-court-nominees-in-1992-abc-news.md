Vice President <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/whitehouse/joe-biden.htm" id="ramplink_Joe Biden_" target="_blank">Joe Biden</a> has criticized Senate Republicans' plan to prevent President Obama from filling the vacancy on <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/supreme-court.htm" id="ramplink_the Supreme Court_" target="_blank">the Supreme Court</a> after Justice <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/antonin-scalia.htm" id="ramplink_Antonin Scalia_" target="_blank">Antonin Scalia</a>’s death, saying in an interview last week that he thinks Republicans “don’t believe” the strategy “makes sense.”
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
But when he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in June 1992, Biden suggested Democrats should “seriously consider” not holding confirmation hearings for a Supreme Court nominee put forward by President George H.W. Bush if a justice were to retire in the final months of the presidential election year.
</p>



<p itemprop="articleBody">
“The Senate Judiciary Committee should seriously consider not scheduling hearings on the nomination, until after the political campaign season is over,” Biden said in a floor address on June 25, 1992, about reforming the Supreme Court confirmation process.
</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody">
Biden claimed that his proposal was not "an attempt to save the seat on the Court in the hopes that a Democrat will be permitted to fill it," a charge Democrats have leveled at Republicans over the past week.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
He also said the cost of keeping the court split 4-4 would be "quite minor" compared to the "bitter fight" that would ensue if the president tried pushing through a nominee.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
In a statement released by the vice president's office, Biden downplayed his 1992 remarks. "Some critics say that one excerpt of my speech is evidence that I oppose filling a Supreme Court vacancy in an election year," he said. "This is not an accurate description of my views on the subject.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
"In the same statement critics are pointing to today, I urged the Senate and White House to work together to overcome partisan differences to ensure the Court functions as the Founding Fathers intended," he continued. "That remains my position today."
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Biden concluded by saying his record as Judiciary Committee Chairman "is hard to beat."
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
"During my career on the Judiciary Committee, I ensured the prompt and fair consideration of nine Supreme Court Justices and the current Senate has a constitutional duty to do the same," he said.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
While Republicans -- most notably Sen. Chuck Grassley, the current chairman of the Judiciary Committee -- have criticized Biden's stance in light of his 1992 comments in 1992, several top GOP senators previously voiced support for positions at odds with their current opposition to confirming a Supreme Court nominee in the final months of the Obama administration.</p>
