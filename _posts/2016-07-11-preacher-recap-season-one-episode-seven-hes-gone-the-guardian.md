<h2><strong>‘Your whole life could change in a moment’</strong></h2>
<p>He’s Gone takes place over the course of a single day: the Sunday of Eugene’s banishment. But it’s intercut with plenty of unnecessary flashback scenes giving more background on Jesse’s daddy issues and relationship with Tulip. It’s a bit of a slow burner, but hopefully it serves as a brief respite before the storm of action in the last few episodes.</p>
<p>As Jesse’s climactic service finally starts, he appears to have succeeded at saving the town, at least superficially. This is by far the most God-fearing congregation we’ve seen yet (even Tulip is slumped down in a pew), and throughout the sequence everyone hangs, rapt by his words. But this is not a moment of triumph for Jesse – we cut ahead through the sermon to Sheriff Root, looking for his son. It looks like Jesse didn’t even use his power on the congregation, bailing at the last minute – perhaps because Eugene’s criticism struck a chord.</p>
<p>After the service the camera pans down to the floor, telegraphing a cut to Eugene in hell, complete with muffled animal noises and screaming. But instead, the episode jumps over to Quincannon’s slaughterhouse, in just one of many reminders of hell peppered throughout this episode, exaggerating small details like the fire that Tulip accidentally sets in the church oven and complemented by a glimpse of Eugene’s empty room. It would be cool if we got to see Preacher’s version of hell. But maybe that’s for another episode (or next season).</p>

</figcaption></figure><p>In flashback, we get some more background on Jesse and Tulip’s relationship – they’ve known each other forever, and have spent their lives overcoming the status gap between their families. (Apparently, the O’Hares have long been bad news in Annville.) After getting into a fight (she bit off Donnie’s nipple) and staying at the Custers’ for a while, young Tulip is taken away by child services on the advice of Jesse’s father, who is later beaten and killed soon after young Jesse prays for his death.</p>
<p>These scenes mostly tell us things we already knew (or worse, that we didn’t need to know), and they’re a boring distraction from what’s actually happening on the show in the present, where Tulip cradling her uncle’s head while a woman walks by with a stroller, staring disdainfully, is the most vulnerable she’s been yet. Pretty much the only reason the flashbacks exist, besides padding, is to confirm that Jesse apparently feels guilty about his father’s because he prayed for it (snooze) and wants to save the town to make up for this non-crime. </p>
<p>Back in the present, where actually consequential stuff is happening, Tulip has another heated confrontation with Cassidy. Their relationship is sufficiently complicated to be interesting now – Cassidy clearly has feelings for Tulip (he uses the phrase “make love” when he talks about their tryst in the car, which is incredibly cute), but cares too much for Jesse to act on them, while Tulip sees Cassidy as an ally against both Carlos and the rigid, hyper-demanding version of Jesse she’s trying to banish from existence. Not much comes out of the argument, except that it persuades Cassidy to confront Jesse with what he really is.</p>

</figcaption></figure><p>It turns out Cassidy saw what happened to Eugene, and spends most of this episode trying to get Jesse to talk about it, in vain, eventually hitting the preacher in the face with a fire extinguisher. Jesse tells Cassidy about Eugene’s origin, as a way of justifying what he did: a lovesick Eugene, it turns out, killed Tracy Loach, then tried to kill himself, only to wind up losing his face. (This differs from Eugene’s origin story in the comic, which is closer to a grunge-inflected poser scheme gone awry. Also, why isn’t he in prison?) Mostly, it confirms that Jesse has become cold, and continues to place his own judgment above basic kindness.</p>
<p>Everything boils over in an incredibly awkward dinner scene, where, among other things, Emily comes close to ratting Jesse out to Sheriff Root, then covers for him (she’s caught him in a lie, and now knows something happened). Tulip lights a fire in the oven, and Cassidy confronts Jesse with his real identity, walking out into the sun to burn. It seems insane that Jesse wouldn’t have fully internalized that Cassidy is a vampire yet, especially since he’s already down with the existence of angels and God and stuff. He has been pretty thick-headed for the past few episodes.</p>
<p>Of course, Jesse didn’t let Cassidy die, or if he did, Cassidy won’t be dead for long. He’s a regular on the show. So is Eugene. They’re both going to be around for a while, somehow. But at least these losses have broken through the veneer of Jesse’s passivity, as he tears up the floors of the church screaming for Eugene. (Something that probably should have happened at the beginning of the episode.) On the other hand, Jesse has a bit more to worry about. After rejecting Quincannon’s attempt to take the church (the show has yet to explain how he escaped from Jesse’s use of his powers, or if it was just a technical loophole in the command), Quincannon is sending a small army after the preacher. Time for action.</p>
