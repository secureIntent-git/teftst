<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="7"><p><span class="articleLocation">FRANKFURT</span> Europe's largest software company, SAP (<span id="symbol_SAPG.DE_0">SAPG.DE</span>), warned late on Friday that first-quarter results would be weaker than expected due to slower sales of software licenses to corporate customers, particularly in Brazil and the United States.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Software license revenues fell 13 percent while the company's newer, but lower-margin cloud software business grew 33 percent. Business customers are shifting to cloud-based software delivered over the Internet instead of relying on older software packages they install and run on in-house computers.     "America was a little more lumpy in terms of the signing of contracts," Chief Executive Bill McDermott told reporters on a conference call, noting that U.S. revenue from its classic on-premise software business grew more slowly than expected.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>First-quarter operating profit, excluding special items, rose 5 percent to 1.10 billion euros ($1.25 billion).    Analysts, on average, had been looking for a first-quarter operating profit, excluding special items, of 1.15 billion euros, with 12 estimates ranging from 1.09 billion to 1.25 billion euros, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The company also reported revenue of 4.73 billion euros, shy of the I/B/E/S average forecast of 4.83 billion euros.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>SAP, whose customers include many of the world's biggest multinational corporations, specializes in business applications ranging from accounting to human resources to supply-chain management.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>The company, and established rivals such as Oracle (<span id="symbol_ORCL.N_1">ORCL.N</span>) and IBM (<span id="symbol_IBM.N_2">IBM.N</span>), are racing to fend off pure cloud software rivals like Salesforce.com (<span id="symbol_CRM.N_3">CRM.N</span>) and Workday Inc (<span id="symbol_WDAY.N_4">WDAY.N</span>) in the market for running complex business operations.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>COMEBACK SEEN    </p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>McDermott said he has "perfect, clear confidence" that SAP can meet the full-year profit targets it had set out in January. He said some software licensing deals the company had expected to close last quarter spilled into the current second quarter.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Ongoing political and macroeconomic instability in Latin America, particularly in Brazil, hurt first-quarter results. North America, coming off a very strong fourth quarter, had a slower start to the year, SAP said in a statement.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa turned in solid software revenues, the company said, while adding that its sales pipeline for 2016 remains strong in all regions.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>It reiterated that it expects 2016 operating profit, excluding items, to range between 6.4 billion and 6.7 billion euros ($7.0 billion to $7.3 billion) at constant currencies. That represents roughly flat growth to an increase of 6 percent.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Analysts, on average, project operating profit of 6.69 billion euros for the current year, according to 27 estimates compiled by Vara Research.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>SAP plans to publish its full quarterly results on April 20, but pre-announced selected figures because they were materially lower than expected. The first quarter is historically SAP's weakest period of the year and comes after a surge in results late last year, typically its strongest seasonal period.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>SAP shares closed down 1 percent at 67.37 euros in Frankfurt on Friday. The stock is 11 percent below record high levels set in December when SAP's cloud transition was running smoothly.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p> ($1 = 0.8774 euro)</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><span id="midArticle_1"/><p> (Reporting by Eric Auchard, Harro ten Wolde and Ilona Wissenbach; editing by James Dalgleish, G Crosse)</p><span id="midArticle_2"/></div>
