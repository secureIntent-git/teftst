 <p>St. Petersburg, FL – Newly released court documents reveal shocking allegations against both Casey Anthony and her defense attorney, Jose Baez.</p><p>In July 2011, a jury found Anthony not guilty in the murder of her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee.</p><p>In a deposition, the private investigator hired by her defense team says Baez and Anthony were involved in a sexual relationship and claims Baez told him “Casey had murdered Caylee and dumped the body somewhere and, he needed all the help he could get to find the body before anyone else did.”</p><p>Dominic Casey made the accusations during a deposition for Anthony’s bankruptcy proceedings.</p><p>In the affidavit, the investigator says Anthony wanted to pin Caylee’s murder on her family or the meter reader who found the toddler’s body.</p><p>Baez hired Casey in August 2008.  Casey says a month later, he overheard Baez tell Anthony that she owed him oral sex in exchange for canceling a television interview.</p><p>“He called the network saying they would have to take a raincheck, hung up the phone," and the told Anthony she owed him oral sex, Casey testified.</p><p>According to Casey, two weeks later he found a naked Anthony coming out of Baez’s private office.</p><p>“Casey told me she had to do what Jose said because she had no money for her defense.  I reminded her that Baez had more than enough money from the network he sold the photographs to pay for her defense.  Casey apologized and assured me it would not happen again,” he said in the deposition.</p><p>Casey has written a book about the Casey Anthony case.  Prominent Tampa attorney Barry Cohen says because of that and a lack of evidence, he would not give much credit to the investigator’s claims.</p><p>“With a financial motive that would be really juicy stuff to help sell his book so I wouldn't get it two cents worth of credibility,” said Cohen.</p><p>Cohen also explained that a sexual relationship between an attorney and a client might not be illegal, but is unethical if it exploits or adversely affects the attorney-client relationship.</p><p>“It would be prudent to say attorneys ought not to be thinking with their little heads when it's time to be thinking with the big heads,” he said.</p><p>10News WTSP anchor Courtney Robinson spoke with Baez by phone.  He brushed off the allegations and told her he had real cases to deal with.</p><p>The Florida Bar confirmed that they do not have an open file on Baez regarding the accusations from Casey’s deposition.</p><p><a href="http://www.wtsp.com/news/photos-casey-anthony-trial/214795417"><strong>PHOTOS: Casey Anthony Trial</strong></a></p> <p> </p><p style=" margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block;"><strong>READ:</strong> <a href="https://www.scribd.com/doc/313814414/Dominic-Casey-affidavits-on-Casey-Anthony" style="text-decoration: underline;" title="View Dominic Casey affidavits on Casey Anthony on Scribd">Dominic Casey affidavits on Casey Anthony</a></p><p><a href="http://www.wtsp.com/news/casey-anthony-before-photos/214808579"><strong>PHOTOS: Casey Anthony Before</strong></a></p> <p><a href="http://www.wtsp.com/news/casey-and-caylee-anthony-photos/214812843"><strong>PHOTOS: Casey and Caylee Anthony</strong></a></p>   </div> </div>
