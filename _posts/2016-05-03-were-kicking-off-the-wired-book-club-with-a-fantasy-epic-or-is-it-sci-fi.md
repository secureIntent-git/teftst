<br><div id="start-of-content"><article class="content link-underline relative body-copy" data-js="content" itemprop="articleBody" readability="63.028820010875"><p>Book clubs never last—or if they do, it’s because people show up for drinks and idle chatter about anything <em>other</em> than the book. Well, it’s time to fix that. That’s why today we’re announcing the launch of WIRED Book Club, wherein each month we read and discuss a new or recent science-fiction/fantasy novel. This is an all-hands effort, led by members of our culture, science, and design teams—and <em>you</em>. After all, speculative fiction demands some speculation.</p>
<p>For May’s inaugural selection, we’ll be reading N.K. Jemisin’s <em>The Fifth Season</em>, the first book in her Broken Earth series. (It was named a Hugo Awards finalist last week, confirming our choice.) We’ve been excited about <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/08/geeks-guide-nk-jemisin/" target="_blank">for some time</a>. Her Inheritance Trilogy made a splash a few years back, and <em>The Fifth Season</em>, which is set on a land mass called the Stillness undergoing rather un-still environmental upheaval, promises to be an even deeper, richer display of both her world-building prowess (there are <em>two</em> appendices) and her predilection for a diverse slate of complex characters.</p>
<p>How is this going to work, though? After all, we’re here, you’re there, and it’s not like we’re going to be meeting for scones and subtext. Or are we? We’ll be hosting an online chat with Jemisin at the end of the month, where we’ll be discussing the book, with questions coming from readers. In the meantime, we’ll divide the book into sections, and aim for weekly check-ins where we use the comment thread for open conversation about the book up to that point. Then, after our discussion with Jemisin, we’ll post a recap with our favorite highlights and insights.</p>
<p>So: let’s get started. Next week, we’ll discuss the first seven chapters. Happy reading!</p>
