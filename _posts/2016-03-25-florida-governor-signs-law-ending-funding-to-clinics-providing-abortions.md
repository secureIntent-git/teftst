<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">TALLAHASSEE, Fla.</span> Florida Governor Rick Scott on Friday signed a law that cuts off state funding for preventive health services to clinics providing abortion and imposes abortion restrictions already being tested before the U.S. Supreme Court.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Florida is among many states adopting new abortion laws as conservatives seek to chip away at the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion. </p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Scott signed 68 new laws and issued statements on some non-controversial bills on Friday but did not comment on the abortion statute. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The bill, which easily passed the Republican-controlled legislature earlier this month, has been the target of television advertisements by Planned Parenthood and protests at the Capitol by women urging a veto.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>John Stemberger, president of the Florida Family Policy Council, called the law "a historic victory," in a statement.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>State funding of abortion was already prohibited, but the new law also blocks money for services for low-income women at the clinics. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>It also requires doctors to have admitting privileges at a hospital - a type of formal affiliation that can be difficult to obtain - within a "reasonable" distance of clinics.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>   In addition, the law requires annual inspection of clinics by health authorities and tightened rules on disposal of aborted fetal tissue.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>"For Rick Scott to prioritize political pandering over his own constituents' access to healthcare is more than cynical. It's shameful," Laura Goodhue, executive director of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates, said in a statement. </p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>She predicted HIV rates will "skyrocket" and teenage pregnancies will rise because women will lose access to regular treatment at state-funded clinics.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>The U.S. Supreme Court is considering a challenge to a similar law in Texas, where several clinics have closed because of new restrictions.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Legislative sponsors in Florida argued that the law was not meant to shutter clinics but protect women with new safety rules.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>The law takes effect July 1 but will probably be challenged in court quickly. Howard Simon, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, said he was not surprised the governor signed the bill.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>"He claims to be for small government, pro-freedom and opposed to putting government in between people and their doctors – except when it comes to Florida's women," said Simon.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Another Florida law passed last year, requiring women to wait 24 hours before getting an abortion, recently took effect and faces a continued legal challenge.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><span id="midArticle_16"/><p> (Reporting by Bill Cotterell in Tallahassee, Florida; Editing by Curtis Skinner and Steve Orlofsky)</p><span id="midArticle_17"/></div>
