        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Chen said BlackBerry is working on licensing its hardware know-how like its virtual keyboard and security software, moves it sees boosting hardware segment revenue and getting it closer to profitability.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The Waterloo, Ontario-based company recognized revenue on roughly 600,000 devices in the quarter. Chen said three million device sales a year at an average price of around $300 would get the unit to break even. He had previously estimated BlackBerry needed to sell five million to achieve this goal.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Software and licensing revenue for the year came to $527 million, exceeding BlackBerry's target of $500 million. It is targeting 30 percent organic growth in that business this fiscal year.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Many analysts and investors remain skeptical.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>"We're looking for even faster growth," said Brian Colello, an analyst at Morningstar, noting BlackBerry needs "exponential software growth" to complete its transformation into a stable, profitable entity.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Overall revenue fell to $464 million from $660 million a year earlier and was about $100 million lower than the average of analyst expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>It reported a net loss of $238 million, or 45 cents a share, in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 29, compared with year-earlier profit of $28 million, or 5 cents a share. Excluding one-time items, it lost 3 cents a share, against expectations for a 10-cents-a-share loss.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><p> (Editing by Cynthia Osterman and James Dalgleish)</p><span id="midArticle_14"/></div>
