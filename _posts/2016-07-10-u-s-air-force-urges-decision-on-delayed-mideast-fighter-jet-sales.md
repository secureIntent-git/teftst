Grant said she "absolutely" saw growing frustration among officials in the three countries, which have asked to buy a variety of U.S. fighter planes.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"It's caused us to do more to reassure them that this one transaction should not impact the larger relationship ... that they are very valued partners," Grant said. "Hopefully the delay in this decision to move forward isnâ€™t going to have any impact." </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Grant said the three requests were still being worked on "at the highest levels of our government." She declined to comment on what was holding up the decisions.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>All three arms sales have stalled amid concerns raised by Israel that equipment sent to Gulf states could fall into the wrong hands and be used against it, and by the Obama administration's desire to integrate arms sales decisions into its broader decision-making on military aid to the Gulf.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The Pentagon and State Department have both have signed off on the sale of 36 F-15 fighter jets to Qatar and 24 F/A-18E/F Super Hornets to Kuwait, both built by Boeing Co, as well as a number of Lockheed Martin Corp F-16 fighter jets to Bahrain.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Grant joins other senior military officials and lawmakers who have weighed in recent months to urge the White House to move forward on the arms sales requests, some of which have been in work for years.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>The sale to Kuwait is worth about $3 billion and the one to Qatar is probably close to $4 billion, according to sources familiar with the matter. The value of the Bahrain deal was not immediately available.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>U.S. Navy Secretary Ray Mabus last month warned the U.S. Navy could see the cost of new F/A-18E/F Super Hornets rise unless the government approves foreign sales of the jets soon.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Mabus said he was frustrated by delays in approving the sale of the Boeing jets to a close U.S. ally.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Senior U.S. officials have said they are keen to see the  Boeing F-15 and F/A-18 production lines in St. Louis, and the Lockheed F-16 line in Fort Worth, Texas, continue, and do not want to foreclose options on fourth-generation aircraft.    </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><p> (Editing by Mark Potter)</p><span id="midArticle_14"/></div>
