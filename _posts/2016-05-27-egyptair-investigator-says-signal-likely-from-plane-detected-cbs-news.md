        <p><strong>CAIRO </strong>-- The chief investigator in the<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/egyptair-flight-804-forensic-investigator-egypt-human-remains-suggest-explosion/"> EgyptAir plane crash</a> that killed all 66 people on board last week has said search teams in the Mediterranean have picked up a beacon believed to be from the doomed aircraft.</p><p>Ayman al-Moqadem said the beacon signal had narrowed down the search to a 3-mile radius. He insisted, however, that it did not mean the flight data and cockpit voice recorders -- the so-called "black boxes" -- had been found.</p><figure class="image pull-none image-large related-gallery"><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/egyptair-flight-ms804-crash/"><span class="img "><img src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/EgyptAir-investigator-says-signal-likely-from-plane-detected-CBS-News.jpg" alt="ap16142365000227.jpg" height="350" width="620" srcset="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/EgyptAir-investigator-says-signal-likely-from-plane-detected-CBS-News.jpg 1x, http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/05/23/90cf6b31-f98e-4e21-acaa-be95e5bc8276/thumbnail/1240x700/b2c76fc156e7ae88fde6b989c85ac6ec/ap16142365000227.jpg 2x"/></span></a><figcaption readability="2.3342541436464"><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/egyptair-flight-ms804-crash/"><p><span class="label">View Gallery</span></p></a><div class="caption" readability="10"><p>This picture posted May 21, 2016, on the official Facebook page of the Egyptian Armed Forces spokesman shows part of a plane chair recovered from EgyptAir flight 804.</p></div><p>

He said the signal that was picked up comes from one of the devices on the plane transmitting its location. He spoke to reporters on Thursday.</p><p>France's air accident investigation agency has said a French naval ship specialized in underwater searches will help search for the black boxes.</p><p>Speaking Wednesday to CBS News correspondent Holly Williams in Cairo, Egypt's Minister of Civil Aviation said "<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/egyptair-flight-804-crash-civil-aviation-minister-says-nothing-has-been-ruled-out/">nothing has been ruled out</a>" in determining the cause of the EgyptAir flight 804 crash.</p><p>"It could have been anything, but mechanical failure is... one of four or five assumptions or possibilities that might have happened to the aircraft," Minister Sherif Fathy said.</p><p>He told Williams the possible causes for the downing of the flight include mechanical failure, a fire on board, an electrical problem, or an act of terrorism.</p><p>"It could have been many other things," Fathy said. "Nothing has been ruled out. And it's too early for that, Holly, the investigation has to really continue and we have to locate the data boxes (black boxes) before we say anything."</p><p>The flight and voice recorders still need to be retrieved, and as Fathy points out, once they are retrieved it could take a period of months to analyze the data on them.</p><p>The chief of EgyptAir said this week that Egypt has contracted two foreign companies to help locate the flight data recorders in Mediterranean. They are believed to sit as deep as 10,000 feet on the seabed.</p>
