		<p>The finale of a fireworks show off the coast of Plymouth, Massachusetts came quicker than expected when the barge carrying the fireworks caught on fire.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wcvb.com/news/barge-catches-fire-during-plymouth-fireworks-celebration/40358710?utm_source=Social&amp;utm_medium=FBPAGE&amp;utm_campaign=WCVB%20Channel%205%20Boston&amp;Content%20Type=Story" target="_blank">WCVB </a>reports that about 15 minutes into the show, onlookers started to see explosions of color on the barge as the remaining fireworks were lit by the blaze.</p>
<p>Police told the television station that no one was injured in the fire, which lasted about 10 minutes. The fire was caused by a "malfunction" and also spread to a second barge, police told WCVB.</p>
