	The co-owner of a famed Brooklyn pizzeria found slain outside his home was carrying more than $10,000 in cash — and it was left behind by his killer, sources said Friday.</p>      <p>&#13;
	Louis Barbati, 61, co-owner of L&amp;B Spumoni Gardens Pizzeria, was shot dead Thursday in the backyard of his Dyker Heights home just after 7 p.m., police said.</p>      <p>&#13;
	He had left work at the pizzeria about half an hour before and drove home in a white Mercedes SUV, sources said.</p>                             <div class="ra-module h" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemid="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Slain-Brooklyn-pizzeria-owner-had-10G-in-cash-on-him-New-York-Daily-News.jpg">  <figure class="ra-figure"><span class="ra-enlarge"/>     <img srcset="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Slain-Brooklyn-pizzeria-owner-had-10G-in-cash-on-him-New-York-Daily-News.jpg 750w, http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2695871.1467387425!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_1200/spumoni2n-3-web.jpg 1200w" alt="FBMD01000aaa03000002610000ade4000083f40000d7040100ec6b01006a370200dc4b02005c6702005f81020027dd0300" src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Slain-Brooklyn-pizzeria-owner-had-10G-in-cash-on-him-New-York-Daily-News.jpg"/><figcaption><h2 class="ra-caption" itemprop="description">Louis Barbati, 61, co-owner of L&amp;B Spumoni Gardens Pizzeria, was shot dead Thursday in the backyard of his Dyker Heights home just after 7 p.m., police said.</h2>   </figcaption></figure></div>             <p>&#13;
	He parked on 76th St., just around the corner from his home on 12th Ave., got out carrying a loaf of bread for dinner and walked up a set of stairs to his backyard, where he was confronted by the gunman.</p>    <p> <a class="ra-related" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/co-owner-nyc-pizzeria-stirred-mob-war-shot-dead-article-1.2695112">Co-owner of NYC pizzeria that nearly stirred mob war shot dead</a> </p>        <p>&#13;
	The hooded gunman, described by police as white, in his 30s and dressed in a black hoodie and gray pants, pumped at least five bullets into Barbati, including two in his back and also hitting him in the arm and leg, a police source said.</p>      <p>&#13;
	As the gunman fled, leaving behind the massive wad of cash, Barbati managed to scream to his wife, who was inside cooking, before collapsing and dying, sources said.</p>                             <div class="ra-module h" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemid="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/1467388807_638_Slain-Brooklyn-pizzeria-owner-had-10G-in-cash-on-him-New-York-Daily-News.jpg">  <figure class="ra-figure"><span class="ra-enlarge"/>        <img srcset="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/1467388807_638_Slain-Brooklyn-pizzeria-owner-had-10G-in-cash-on-him-New-York-Daily-News.jpg 750w, http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2695867.1467387422!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_1200/spumoni2n-6-web.jpg 1200w" alt="Barbati&#x2019;s body was found slumped near the door of the house, police said." src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/1467388807_638_Slain-Brooklyn-pizzeria-owner-had-10G-in-cash-on-him-New-York-Daily-News.jpg"/><figcaption><h2 class="ra-caption" itemprop="description">Barbati’s body was found slumped near the door of the house, police said.</h2>    <span class="ra-credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(David Wexler/For New York Daily News)</span>   </figcaption></figure></div>             <p>&#13;
	“The killer didn’t take any property,” a police source said.</p>      <p>&#13;
	His wife had heard the gunshots but thought they were fireworks, sources said. His two sons and another woman were also in the home at the time of the shooting, sources said.</p>                               <div class="ra-module v" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemid="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/1467388807_902_Slain-Brooklyn-pizzeria-owner-had-10G-in-cash-on-him-New-York-Daily-News.jpg">  <figure class="ra-figure"><span class="ra-enlarge"/>        <img srcset="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/1467388807_902_Slain-Brooklyn-pizzeria-owner-had-10G-in-cash-on-him-New-York-Daily-News.jpg 750w, http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2695869.1467387424!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_1200/spumoni2n-1-web.jpg 1200w" alt="A mob war like a &quot;Sopranos&quot; script nearly erupted over the &quot;gravy&quot; recipe at the pizzeria several years ago, according to testimony in a 2012 extortion case." src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/1467388807_902_Slain-Brooklyn-pizzeria-owner-had-10G-in-cash-on-him-New-York-Daily-News.jpg"/><figcaption><h2 class="ra-caption" itemprop="description">A mob war like a "Sopranos" script nearly erupted over the "gravy" recipe at the pizzeria several years ago, according to testimony in a 2012 extortion case.</h2>    <span class="ra-credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Fevelo Nicholas Freelance NYDN/FREELANCE NYDN)</span>   </figcaption></figure></div>             <p>&#13;
	The wife ran outside when she heard the screaming and called 911, sources said.</p>      <p>&#13;
	Barbati’s body was found slumped near the door of the house, police said.</p>      <p>&#13;
	It was unusual for Barbati to bring home that much cash — something he did only about six times a year.</p>      <p>&#13;
	L&amp;B's, known for its Sicilian pizza and Italian ices, was founded by Barbati's grandfather in 1939. Ludovico Barbati started off selling pizza products from a horse and wagon on the streets of Brooklyn.</p>                                            <p>&#13;
	He built the current restaurant on 86th St. in Gravesend in the 1950s.</p>      <p>&#13;
	A mob war like a "Sopranos" script nearly erupted over the "gravy" recipe at the pizzeria several years ago, according to testimony in a 2012 extortion case.</p>      <p>&#13;
	Frank Guerra, a reputed Columbo crime family associate whose ex-wife was a part owner of the pizzeria, was acquitted of a double murder of former underboss Joseph Scopo and Staten Island club owner Michael Devine, as well as extortion of a former Spumoni employee — who he accused of lifting L&amp;B's secret sauce recipe.</p>                             <div class="ra-module h" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemid="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/1467388807_187_Slain-Brooklyn-pizzeria-owner-had-10G-in-cash-on-him-New-York-Daily-News.jpg">  <figure class="ra-figure"><span class="ra-enlarge"/>        <img srcset="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/1467388807_187_Slain-Brooklyn-pizzeria-owner-had-10G-in-cash-on-him-New-York-Daily-News.jpg 750w, http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2695866.1467387421!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_1200/spumoni2n-8-web.jpg 1200w" alt="A worker cleans blood stains on the door to the backyard where Barbati was gunned down." src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/1467388807_187_Slain-Brooklyn-pizzeria-owner-had-10G-in-cash-on-him-New-York-Daily-News.jpg"/><figcaption><h2 class="ra-caption" itemprop="description">A worker cleans blood stains on the door to the backyard where Barbati was gunned down.</h2>    <span class="ra-credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(David Wexler/For New York Daily News)</span>   </figcaption></figure></div>             <p>&#13;
	Guerra is currently serving time for dealing Oxycontin.</p>        <p>&#13;
	Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, and City Councilmembers Vincent Gentile and Mark Trager scheduled a press conference at Barbati’s restaurant to discuss the murder Friday morning, but then abruptly cancelled it.</p>
