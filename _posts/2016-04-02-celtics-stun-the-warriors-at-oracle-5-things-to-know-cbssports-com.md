        <p>The <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/page/BOS/boston-celtics">Boston Celtics</a> shocked the <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/teams/page/GS/golden-state-warriors">Golden State Warriors</a> with a 109-106 victory over the defending champions at Oracle Arena on Friday. It was the Warriors' first home loss of the season, and it dropped them to 68-8 <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/25539142/road-to-73-warriors-finally-stumble-at-home-against-boston">as they chase the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls' single-season wins record</a>. Perhaps they can take solace in the fact that they still have the best record through 76 games in NBA history.</p><p>Boston guard <a class="playerLink" href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/playerpage/1647553/isaiah-thomas">Isaiah Thomas</a> scored a team-high 22 points, but this was a team effort. <a class="playerLink" href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/playerpage/1755190/evan-turner">Evan Turner</a> had 21 points on 8-for-13 shooting, plus five rebounds, five assists and a couple of huge plays late in the game. <a class="playerLink" href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/playerpage/1992829/jared-sullinger">Jared Sullinger</a> finished with 20 points and 12 rebounds. The Celtics forced 22 Golden State turnovers and earned their biggest win of the season. Warriors star <a class="playerLink" href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/playerpage/1685204/stephen-curry">Stephen Curry</a> had a game-high 29 points on 9-for-19 shooting, including 8 for 14 from 3-point range, but he had nine turnovers. </p><p>Five things to know:</p><p><strong>1. The streak is over. </strong>Golden State was 36-0 at home heading into this game, but it was more than that. Until this game, they hadn't even trailed at halftime there this calendar year. Dating back to last season, the Warriors had won 54 straight home games. Their last loss at Oracle was Jan. 27, 2015, when <a class="playerLink" href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/playerpage/1622510/derrick-rose">Derrick Rose</a> hit <a href="http://https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJsGGchwd5c">a stepback jumper</a> over <a class="playerLink" href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/playerpage/1647559/klay-thompson">Klay Thompson</a> to give the Bulls an overtime victory. That is an incredible run, and it must have been a strange feeling for season-ticket holders who don't remember what it feels like to leave the arena after a loss.</p><p>Fun fact, <a href="http://https://twitter.com/coopmavs/status/716132589686419460">courtesy of Dallas Mavericks radio play-by-play announcer Chuck Cooperstein</a>: Golden State has still won 46 straight at home against Western Conference teams. Its last in-conference loss was Nov. 11, 2014, against the San Antonio Spurs. That game was also the last time the Warriors lost at home in regulation.</p><p>The Spurs, of course, still have a chance to be the first NBA team to go undefeated at home for an entire season. They're 38-0 at AT&amp;T Center, and they host Golden State on April 10. The 1985-86 Celtics have the best home record in NBA history at 40-1.</p><p><strong>2. The Warriors had a slow, slow, slow start.</strong> From the opening tip, Boston pressured Curry and Thompson as much as possible but did not switch. The Celtics held the Splash Brothers to a combined 11 points on 13 shots in the first half. Curry had seven turnovers and missed a couple of open looks, failing to score a single point until he got free for a 3-pointer in the final seconds of the first quarter. Boston probably should have been able to build a bigger lead early on, but it couldn't get going on offense either. Golden State didn't drop this game just because of what happened down the stretch. </p><p><strong>3. There was a third-quarter duel. </strong>Curry started the second half with two straight 3-pointers, and proceeded to make all six of his 3-point attempts in the period. He went off for 21 points in that quarter alone, which sounds crazy until you realize that it was the ninth time this season he had scored 20-plus in a quarter. The highlight? The swish from near the logo, of course:</p><p>It wasn't just the Steph show, though. His All-Star point guard counterpart, Isaiah Thomas, scored 18 points in the third, racing around the court and going 7 for 9 from the field. It came out of nowhere, too -- Thomas went scoreless in the first half. </p><p><strong>4. Boston's composure was unbelievable. </strong>ESPN showed a clip of Brad Stevens talking in the huddle after the Curry explosion. He complimented the way they were playing and told them not to react emotionally to Curry making shots. Golden State is so good at demoralizing its opponents, but it never happened to the Celtics, even when the best player on the planet was making the crowd go crazy.</p><p>With 7:20 left in the game, Boston led 95-85 and Warriors coach Steve Kerr elected to bring back Curry and <a class="playerLink" href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/playerpage/1992792/draymond-green">Draymond Green</a> earlier than normal. Green played the center spot, and the game immediately changed. He scored eight straight Golden State points and ensured that this would have a tight finish, but the Celtics never surrendered their lead. Turner made a clutch jumper in the post over Thompson and then another midrange shot off the dribble. Thomas made a contested layup off an inbounds play with 8.3 seconds left after Curry came as close as you can get to picking off the pass. </p><p>The biggest late-game gaffe was committed by the Warriors: With less than four minutes to go, <a class="playerLink" href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/playerpage/1622549/brandon-rush">Brandon Rush</a> turned the ball over on a fast break when an easy layup could have made it a one-point game. This resulted in an easy layup for Thomas on the other end. Rush might have been caught off-guard because he expected <a class="playerLink" href="http://www.cbssports.com/nba/players/playerpage/400530/leandro-barbosa">Leandro Barbosa</a> to pass to an open Curry, but it was a rough time for a mistake like that.</p><p><strong>5. This chase for 73 really livens things up, doesn't it? </strong>In a lot of ways, this game was similar to Golden State's overtime win against the Utah Jazz on Wednesday. Curry and company just couldn't force overtime. This had a playoff feel to it, and that's rare in early April for a team that is surely going to finish with the best record in the league. Everyone knows how badly the Warriors want to make history, and they're so close to it now.</p><p>All year, Golden State games have been must-watch TV, especially if they're close in the final minutes. With less than two weeks left in the regular season, it's at another level. </p><p><figure><img src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Celtics-stun-the-Warriors-at-Oracle-5-things-to-know-CBSSportscom.jpg" width="640" height="400" alt="The Celtics have reason to celebrate.
