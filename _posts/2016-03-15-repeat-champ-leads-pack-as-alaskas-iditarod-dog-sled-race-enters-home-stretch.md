His father departed about 30 minutes later. </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>At White Mountain, all mushers must take a mandatory 8-hour rest, so the son was able to leave first. Last year, son and father finished first and second.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>"We all know too well what can happen," Dallas Seavey said in an interview posted on the Iditarod website. "I have way too much respect for my competitors to say I've won it anytime before we’ve actually crossed the finish line." </p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Should either Seavey prevail, it would be the fifth straight year a family member has won the race. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Dallas, now 29, won in 2012 to become the youngest winner in race history. Mitch, now 56, won in 2013 to become the oldest competitor to win - it was his second victory. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>“It’s 50-50,” Mitch Seavey said. “Either I will or I won’t.”</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The Iditarod commemorates a 1925 rescue mission that carried diphtheria serum by sled-dog relay to the coastal community of Nome. The trail cutting through Alaska's tundra to the Bering Sea coastline is marked by darkness and steep climbs.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Of the 85 mushers and their dogs that set off on March 6, 11 mushers have withdrawn from the race. While most of the competitors are from Alaska, racers have come from Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>This year's winner will receive $70,000 and a new pick-up truck, while other top finishers will take home cash prizes from a race purse that exceeds $725,000.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>The leaders may face fierce winds that have been powerful enough to alter the race's outcome. Two years ago, winds knocked four-time winner Jeff King off the trail, paving the way for Dallas Seavey.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Overnight forecasts call for 30-mph (48 kph) wind gusts and temperatures pushing 10 below zero Fahrenheit (-23 c) along the Norton Sound where competitors will make their final push.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Zirkle, who has posted three runner-up finishes in the last four years, has had to fight more than the tundra this year. On Sunday, a man accused of attacking Zirkle and another musher in a snowmobile appeared in court.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>One dog was killed and three other dogs were injured in the incident.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><span id="midArticle_1"/><p> (Reporting by Steve Quinn in Juneau; Editing by Eric M.
