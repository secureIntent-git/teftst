<p itemprop="articleBody">
Police are still searching for a man convicted of manslaughter who escaped a New Jersey state correctional facility earlier this week.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Arthur Buckel, 38, had escaped from the Bayside State Prison on Tuesday, just weeks before being eligible for parole.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
On Wednesday, authorities posted surveillance images of Buckel at a local <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/business/companies/cvs.htm" id="ramplink_CVS_" target="_blank">CVS</a> Pharmacy in Barnegat -- located about 50 miles south of the capital of Trenton -- where police located the stolen vehicle he was allegedly driving.
</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody">
An image of Buckel was also released by police showing what he might look like with a shaved face.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Buckel was serving a two year sentence for assault and burglary, but records indicate Buckel previously served 14 years for manslaughter. He was paroled in 2010, and went back to prison on assault and burglary charges in 2015.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Residents in Barnegat were told to say indoors Wednesday while schools were placed on lockdown. Police said they will open today, with increased police presence at every school.</p>
