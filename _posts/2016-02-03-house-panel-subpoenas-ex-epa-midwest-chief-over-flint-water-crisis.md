<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="7"><p><span class="articleLocation">WASHINGTON</span> The U.S. House of Representatives has subpoenaed the former Midwest chief of the Environmental Protection Agency over the Flint, Michigan, drinking water crisis, Representative Jason Chaffetz said on Wednesday.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The panel subpoenaed EPA's Susan Hedman to appear at a deposition in Washington later this month. Hedman, who resigned this week, had played down a memo by an EPA employee that said tests had shown high levels of lead in the city's water, telling Flint and Michigan administrators it was only a draft report. </p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The EPA has agreed to provide all of Hedman's emails by the end of the week, Chaffetz, who heads the House Oversight panel, said at a hearing on the crisis. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Chaffetz said his panel had also issued a second subpoena to Darnell Earley, who was Flint's state-appointed emergency manager when the city switched from Detroit's system to the Flint River for its water supply.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>"Participation in this committee is not optional," Chaffetz said.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Flint, a working-class suburb about an hour north of Detroit, is grappling with the health and political fallout over the switch after the more-corrosive river water put more lead into the system. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Lead is a known toxic agent that can damage the nervous system.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Federal authorities have launched a criminal probe into the contamination. State officials have apologized over the crisis, and U.S. lawmakers are pushing for more federal aid to help the city.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/></div>
