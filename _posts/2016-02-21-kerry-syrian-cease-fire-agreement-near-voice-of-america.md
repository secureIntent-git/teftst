		<p>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday the "path to peace" in Syria is "actually right in front of us now," but that path did not come soon enough for the scores of people killed hours earlier by twin explosions in a Syrian town.</p>

<p>A human rights monitor says the death toll from double blasts in Homs killed 46 people with dozens more wounded.</p>

<p>The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the explosions struck the pro-government neighborhood of  al-Zahraa and most of those killed appeared to be civilians.</p>

<p>Homs has been the target of multiple attacks in recent months, killing and wounding scores of people. The Observatory said the blasts were among the largest to hit the neighborhood in the five-year-old civil war.</p>

<p>Kerry, speaking in Jordan Sunday, said Syria negotiators are "closer to a cease-fire today" than they have ever been.</p>

<p>The top U.S. diplomat said it is his hope that U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin will discuss the provisional agreement "as soon as it is appropriate" and then proceed with the implementation.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Kerry said the Syrian civil war is a "humanitarian catastrophe" and its solution "will not be found in any alliance" with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.</p>

<p>The top American diplomat said he talked on the phone with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov about the conditions for a Syria cease-fire.  </p>

<p><strong>Rebel group 'willing'</strong></p>

<p>The main rebel coalition in Syria has said it is willing to accept a temporary truce, but only if Russia calls a halt to its airstrikes and the Damascus government ends its offensive near the Syrian-Turkish border.</p>

<div class="contentImage floatNone" style="width:640px"><div class="watermark"><a href="http://gdb.voanews.com/4BA7A56B-65B1-4334-AC38-C323B8CC3BDD_mw1024_s_n.jpg" rel="ibox" title="In this photo released by the Syrian official news agency SANA, Syrian citizens gather at the scene where two blasts exploded in the pro-government neighborhood of Zahraa, in Homs province, Syria, Feb. 21, 2016."><img class="photo" alt="In this photo released by the Syrian official news agency SANA, Syrian citizens gather at the scene where two blasts exploded in the pro-government neighborhood of Zahraa, in Homs province, Syria, Feb. 21, 2016." border="0" src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1456060030_971_Kerry-Syrian-Cease-fire-Agreement-Near-Voice-of-America.jpg" /></a></div><span class="imageCaption">In this photo released by the Syrian official news agency SANA, Syrian citizens gather at the scene where two blasts exploded in the pro-government neighborhood of Zahraa, in Homs province, Syria, Feb. 21, 2016.</span></div>

<p>Russia has said it will not stop its airstrikes against what it calls terrorist targets in Syria, even if there is international agreement on a temporary truce, which diplomats have been calling a "cessation of hostilities."</p>

<p>The United States and others involved in trying to end the Syrian civil war say most Russian bombs are directed at rebels fighting the Syrian government, not at Islamic State terrorists.</p>

<p><strong>Kerry, Lavrov discussions</strong></p>

<p>U.S. officials have given a guarded account a conversation Kerry and Lavrov had Saturday, reviewing the work of two teams working in Geneva on the Syrian crisis – one on the urgent need to get humanitarian assistance to civilians trapped by the civil war in Syria, the other on a temporary truce intended to lead to a full and formal cease-fire.</p>

<p>Both sides agreed there has been some progress in delivering aid shipments to civilian neighborhoods under siege by Syrian government troops and their allies.</p>

<p>A U.S. statement added that humanitarian groups need immediate access to additional areas, and that future deliveries should be "sustained and unimpeded."</p>

<p>The Syrian rebel coalition known as the High Negotiations Committee met in Saudi Arabia Saturday and condemned Russia's military action supporting the Damascus government.</p>

<div class="contentImage floatNone" style="width:640px"><div class="watermark"><a href="http://gdb.voanews.com/8623B7F8-DC29-4E46-9BB7-3BD7FDFEA19E_mw1024_s_n.jpg" rel="ibox" title="Syria's President Bashar al-Assad speaks to Spanish newspaper El Pais in Damascus, Feb. 20, 2016."><img class="photo" alt="Syria's President Bashar al-Assad speaks to Spanish newspaper El Pais in Damascus, Feb. 20, 2016." border="0" src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1456060030_136_Kerry-Syrian-Cease-fire-Agreement-Near-Voice-of-America.jpg" /></a></div><span class="imageCaption">Syria's President Bashar al-Assad speaks to Spanish newspaper El Pais in Damascus, Feb. 20, 2016.</span></div>

<p>The coalition said Russia has "shown disdain for the international community and disregard for the lives of Syrians."  </p>

<p>Russia's airstrikes have been blamed for increasing the war's toll on Syrian civilians, prompting more of them to leave their homes as refugees and try to flee across the border into Turkey.</p>

<p><strong>Russia's UN request rejected</strong></p>

<p>Moscow has complained that Turkey is about to send ground forces into Syria, and it called for Security Council action to block that at an emergency meeting Friday.</p>

<p>Other Security Council member rejected Russia's draft resolution, and Turkey's U.N. ambassador said his country would only take such a direct role in Syria if it was backed by the United Nations.</p>

<p>Russia's proposal to the Security Council did not mention Turkey by name, but its intent was clear. It strongly condemned cross-border shelling into Syria and what Russia says is an unrestricted flow of "terrorist" fighters and illegal weapons shipments into</p>

<p>Syria's main opposition group agreed to the "possibility" of a temporary truce Saturday while harshly criticizing Russia for failing to hold to a temporary agreed-upon cease-fire.</p>

<p>The High Negotiations Committee, a Saudi-backed coalition of Syrian opposition groups, issued a statement saying Russia had shown "disdain for the international community and disregard for the lives of Syrians."</p>

<p><strong>Humanitarian aid</strong></p>

<p>The groups agreed on the possibility of a deal if the United Nations could guarantee a cease-fire and the delivery of humanitarian aid.</p>

<p>The statement followed Russia's call for an urgent meeting of the U.N. Security Council to discuss its concerns that Turkey may be planning to send ground troops into Syria.</p>

<p>The Russian delegation presented a one-page draft resolution that would have condemned such a move. It also “strongly” condemned cross-border shelling, the flow of terrorist fighters and the illegal movement of weapons from Syria’s “neighbors.”</p>
