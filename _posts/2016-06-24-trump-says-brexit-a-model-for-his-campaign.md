<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="6"><p><span class="articleLocation">TURNBERRY, Scotland</span> U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump thrust himself into the heart of Britain's vote to leave the European Union on Friday, calling it a "great thing" and drawing parallels to his own insurgent campaign.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>In Scotland to reopen a golf resort he owns, the wealthy New York businessman wasted no time interpreting the outcome of the "Brexit" vote as an example of a global uprising against the established order, an argument he said fits in with his own campaign to shake up Washington by renegotiating free trade deals and stopping illegal immigration.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>"People want to take their country back. They want to have independence in a sense. You see it with Europe, all over Europe," said Trump, 70, the presumptive Republican nominee for president. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>He said the economic shock from the vote would ebb over time and that more European countries might want to break with the 28-nation European Union. He said Americans would have a chance "to re-declare their independence" and "reject today’s rule by the global elite" when they vote on Nov. 8.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>“So I think you're going to have this happen more and more. I really believe that, and I think that it’s happening in the United States. It's happening by the fact that I've done so well in the polls," he said.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Trump's rival, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, said in a statement: "This time of uncertainty only underscores the need for calm, steady, experienced leadership in the White House to protect Americans' pocketbooks and livelihoods, to support our friends and allies, to stand up to our adversaries, and to defend our interests.  </p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>"It also underscores the need for us to pull together to solve our challenges as a country, not tear each other down," said Clinton, 68, a former U.S. secretary of state, who had openly favored Britain's remaining in the EU.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>More than half a million Britons signed a petition earlier this year to bar Trump from entering Britain, where he has business interests, in response to his call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>British lawmakers decided against a ban as a violation of free speech.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>TRUMP ASSAILS OBAMA</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Trump assailed as inappropriate Democratic President Barack Obama's open appeals to Britain not to split off. Shaking off a tradition of not commenting on U.S. politics from foreign soil, Trump said Obama had been embarrassed.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>"It's something he shouldn't have done. It's not his country. It's not his part of the world. He shouldn't have done it. And I actually think that his recommendation perhaps caused it to fail," Trump said.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Trump arrived in his signature helicopter at Turnberry near his clubhouse resort, a Scottish flag blowing in the wind.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Joined by sons Don Jr. and Eric and daughter Ivanka, the candidate praised his mother who was born in Scotland, his children who manage his business affairs and the golf course itself, dismissing complaints from Republicans that he should have stuck to the campaign trail at home.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>As it happened, by turning up when he did, he drew global televised attention to his views on the Brexit vote within hours of Britons waking up to the surprising result.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>"I said this was going to happen and I think that it's a great thing," said Trump, who weeks ago said he would be inclined to leave the EU.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Trump had exchanged insults with British Prime Minister David Cameron, who supported staying in the EU and said on Friday after the vote he would resign by October. Cameron had called Trump's anti-immigrant policy ideas divisive and wrong.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>"I think David Cameron is a good man. He was wrong on this.  He didn't get the mood of his country right. He was surprised.  I think he was very surprised to see what happened but he is a good man," Trump said, predicting that Britain and the United States would remain "great allies."</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>'MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN'</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Wearing a white hat emblazoned with his "Make America Great Again" campaign slogan on his arrival, Trump walked up to the news conference at the famed Turnberry course with bagpipers heralding his arrival.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Trump was visiting the golf resort in his family's ancestral homeland to showcase his far-flung business empire. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>His visit to Turnberry, to be followed by a stop at his resort in Aberdeen on Saturday, coincided with a vote that exposed deep divisions in Britain and dealt the biggest blow to the European project of greater unity since World War Two.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Scotland voted by a margin of 62 percent to 38 percent to remain in the EU, a result sharply at odds with Britain as a whole, which voted 52 percent to 48 percent to leave.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Some Scots who are Turnberry members and who sat in the front row at Trump's news conference muttered "no" whenever the subject of Scotland leaving the EU came up.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Trump, who has yet to hold public office and rates unfavorably with 70 percent of Americans in an opinion poll, defeated a crowded field of opponents for the Republican nomination while weathering one controversy after another. The latest was over the firing of his campaign manager this week, a month before the party convention.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Turnberry is a storied course where the Open Championship has been staged four times. Trump invested $290 million in renovating the resort and golf course on Scotland's west coast, 85 km (53 miles) southwest of Glasgow.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><p> (Additional reporting by Doina Chiacu; Editing by Howard Goller)</p><span id="midArticle_14"/></div>
