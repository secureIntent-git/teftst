<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="6"><p><span class="articleLocation">WASHINGTON</span> U.S. and UK spy agencies and police may soon be allowed to directly ask media companies in each others' countries for email and online chat data for people being investigated, under a tentative bilateral deal, officials said on Friday.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>As governments worldwide and online companies struggle to strike a balance between privacy rights and law enforcement imperatives, three U.S. officials confirmed a pact is in the works, although it would require congressional approval.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>"The proposed agreement, which remains under discussion, would be reciprocal and would require legislation to take effect," said a U.S. Justice Department official.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>First reported by The Washington Post, the talks were focused on letting UK agencies, such as counter-intelligence unit MI5, serve "production orders" on U.S. firms demanding data for “live intercepts” in inquiries involving UK citizens. </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>UK agencies might also be able to ask U.S. companies to turn over stored data, such as emails.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The Post quoted a U.S. official saying that British nationals, including criminals, are using U.S. data providers such as Google, Facebook and Hotmail, making it hard for foreign agencies to get legal access to data for criminal and counter-terrorism inquiries.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The agreement's main goal is to clear up legal conflicts faced by U.S. communications service providers when Britain issues an order seeking electronic data on users abroad, a request that may run afoul of U.S. law, the official said.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>A U.S. government source, who asked for anonymity on sensitive legal issues, said U.S. law generally bars companies from complying with foreign data requests, even though criminal inquiries often hinge on cross-border communications. As a result, U.S. firms can face a tough choice: cooperate with a request and break U.S. law or ignore it and comply with the law.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>A spokesperson for Britain's Foreign Office said Britain was "not going to comment on confidential discussions."</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>But the official noted big international technology companies had called for a "robust, principled and transparent framework" on data requests "across jurisdictions." </p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>The official said British Prime Minister David Cameron and Home Secretary (internal security minister) Theresa May were in preliminary discussions with other governments on the matter.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Representative Adam Schiff, top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Congress should monitor any privacy and civil liberties issues, "including making sure these British orders do not cover U.S. persons or individuals within the U.S., do not permit bulk collection, and have due process protections."</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><p> (Editing by <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=kevin.drawbaugh&amp;">Kevin Drawbaugh</a> and <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=james.dalgleish&amp;">James Dalgleish</a>)</p><span id="midArticle_14"/></div>
