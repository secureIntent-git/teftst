		<p>South Korea's Yonhap news agency said North Korea is preparing to defy international sanctions and conduct a fifth nuclear test.</p>

<p>Yonhap said Sunday it has learned from various government sources that activity at the North's Punggye-ri nuclear test site has "increased two- to threefold recently."</p>

<p>The unidentified officials believe trucks seen moving in and out of the site may be carrying nuclear technicians.</p>

<p>Concerns that Pyongyang is about to conduct another nuclear test comes as the regime prepares to hold a rare meeting of its ruling Workers Party in early May.</p>

<p>Leader Kim Jong Un is expected to use the congress to repeat recent claims of advancements in the North's nuclear and ballistic missile programs, including development of a miniaturized nuclear warhead to fit on long-range ballistic missiles.</p>

<p>None of these claims have been verified, and many observers have accused North Korea of exaggerating its advanced military capabilities.</p>

<p>Experts also believe last week's failure of a medium-range ballistic missile to mark the birthday of founding president Kim Il Sung may also prompt the North to carry out another nuclear test.</p>

<p>The United Nations imposed a set of new and stronger sanctions on North Korea in response to Pyongyang's fourth nuclear test in January, and a ballistic missile test the following month.</p>
