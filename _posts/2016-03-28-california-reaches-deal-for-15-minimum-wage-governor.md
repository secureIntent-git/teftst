<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">SACRAMENTO</span> California Governor Jerry Brown said on Monday he had reached a deal with top legislators and labor leaders to gradually raise the minimum wage to $15, the latest in a wave of minimum wage increases at the state level following a push by Democrats.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The proposal, which still must win approval from moderate lawmakers in the California assembly, would gradually raise the state's minimum wage to $15, but give the governor the right to opt out if the economy faltered.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Such a move would give California the highest statewide minimum wage. The federal minimum wage has remained at $7.25 an hour for more than six years. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Raising the minimum wage has cropped up on many Democratic Party candidates' agendas ahead of the November presidential, congressional and state elections. The issue could help mobilize Democratic voters and galvanize support from labor unions.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>"An agreement has been reached with key labor leaders, legislative leaders and my administration to raise the minimum wage over time to $15 an hour, making California the first state to do that," Brown said at a press conference in Sacramento. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"It's a matter of economic justice and it makes sense," Brown said. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The deal would commit California to raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022 for large businesses and 2023 for smaller firms.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>The measure’s chances of passing the legislature will depend on support from moderate Democrats, who have held up other measures backed by the governor. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Democratic Party presidential hopeful U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has called for raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by the year 2020. </p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>The idea has been opposed by Republicans and some business groups, who have said a higher minimum would harm small businesses and strain the budgets of government agencies.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Christopher Thornberg, founding partner at Beacon Economics, said increasing the minimum wage was not an effective tool in reducing poverty because those most at risk of falling into poverty tend lose their jobs when employers cut positions.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>"This is not costless," Thornberg said. “These are the people that businesses will say, "If I’m going to pay $15 bucks an hour, I’m not going to hire them.'"</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Fourteen states and several cities began 2016 with minimum wage increases, typically phasing in raises that will ultimately take them to between $10 and $15 an hour.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><span id="midArticle_14"/><p> (Reporting by Sharon Bernstein, Robin Respaut and Dan Whitcomb; Writing by Dan Whitcomb; Editing by Grant McCool and Alan Crosby)</p><span id="midArticle_15"/></div>
