The transaction needs to win the approval of more than half of Corus' minority shareholders, as it is a related-party deal with the Shaw family owning controlling stakes in both Shaw Communications and Corus.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The majority of the proxies have come in ahead of the vote, and over 75 percent of the proxies tendered are in favor of the transaction, one of the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the matter is private. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"It's a done deal," the source said.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>It is still unclear though whether the vote will proceed on Wednesday, as the Ontario's securities regulator is currently weighing whether Corus needs to provide additional disclosures.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The regulator, which held a hearing on the matter on Friday, has now adjourned the matter until Monday, March 7. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>A Corus lawyer at the hearing said the company has so far not received objections from any other minority investors and that it expects to win sufficient minority shareholder support for the deal.  </p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Catalyst Capital on Friday called on the Shaw family to prove the deal was the result of a fair, competitive process.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Catalyst, in an open letter, said Corus is overpaying for the assets and asked the family to disclose the number of offers and the price ranges for the offers it received.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>"The Shaw Family respects the independence of the process and the work done by the independent special committees of Corus and Shaw Communications and has no additional comment," a spokesman for Shaw Communications said in an email. </p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Corus has termed Catalyst's claims misleading and said it is paying a fair price. Proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis are advising shareholders to back the transaction.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><p> (Editing by Euan Rocha and Tom Brown)</p><span id="midArticle_14"/></div>
