Residents were asked to stay indoors temporarily.</p> <p>The incident was initially treated as a criminal rather than a terror investigation, with authorities looking into possible underworld links by the driver.</p> <p>The explosion, officials said, occurred shortly before 8 a.m. local time. Images on the scene showed a gray, 4-door Volkswagen Passat, its hood crumpled and its doors bent. The vehicle was apparently in motion, traveling down the city’s Bismarck Street, when it exploded and flipped over, according to Berlin police spokesman Michael Merkle. </p> <p>Merkle confirmed that the driver was a 43-year-old male of “a migrant background,” but gave no further details.</p><div class="inline-content inline-video" readability="34">  <p> <span class="pb-caption">One person is killed after a car explodes while moving along a road in central Berlin, police say.
