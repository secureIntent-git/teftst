Reuters could not reach Holton for comment.    </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Nearly 300 yearbooks were distributed to students before the erroneous photo caption was discovered, said representatives for the Chaffey Joint Union High School District, which oversees the school about 45 miles (70 km) east of Los Angeles.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>School officials asked students who received those yearbooks to return them so they could be corrected with a sticker affixing the student's correct name to the photo. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Officials at the school, which has more than 3,000 students, had withheld the majority of the yearbooks and those also are being fixed, representatives said.   </p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The student has disputed contentions from school officials that the caption was a "misprint." Muslim advocacy group the Council on American-Islamic Relations has said the incident should be investigated for any possible bias.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>ISIS, a name often used to refer to the militant group Islamic State that controls swathes of Iraq and Syria, has claimed responsibility for attacks in Paris and Brussels and a number of other countries.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>

They later died in a shootout with police.    </p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the Los Angeles chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said in a statement over the weekend the organization and the student's family were worried about the girl's safety as a result of being falsely labeled as a member of ISIS.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><span id="midArticle_11"/><p> (Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis; Editing by Daniel Trotta, Toni Reinhold)</p><span id="midArticle_12"/></div>
