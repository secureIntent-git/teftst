<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">SEOUL</span> North Korea can mount a nuclear warhead on a medium-range missile, a South Korean official said on Tuesday in a new assessment of the capability of a country that conducted its fourth nuclear test this year.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said last month his country had miniaturized nuclear warheads to mount on ballistic missiles. It was his first direct statement of a claim often made in state media though never independently verified. [nL4N16G5IY]</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>"We believe they have accomplished miniaturization of a nuclear warhead to mount it on a Rodong missile," the South Korean official, with knowledge of South Korea's assessment of the Northâ€™s nuclear program, told a small group of reporters on condition of anonymity.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The Rodong missile can fire a 1 tonne (1,100 lb) warhead a distance of up to 2,000 km (1,250 miles), the official said. That would put all of South Korea, most of Japan and parts of Russia and China in range.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>"We believe they have the ability to mount a nuclear warhead on a Rodong. Whether they will fire it like that is a political decision," said the official.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>There was no direct evidence that the North has successfully mounted a warhead on such a missile, the South Korean official said. He declined to discuss the basis for the change in assessment.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Staunch U.S. ally South Korea has been facing off against its rival to the north for decades. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>The South's conservative president, Park Geun-hye, has reversed a policy of trying to engage the North in dialogue and has instead adopted a hard line against it, particularly since the North conducted its fourth nuclear test on Jan. 6 and a month later launched a long-range rocket putting an object into space orbit.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>The test and launch prompted the U.N. Security Council to impose new sanctions.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>South Korea has previously said North Korea had made progress in its efforts to miniaturize a nuclear warhead but the capability was incomplete. South Korea's Defence Ministry said on Tuesday that assessment remained the military's position.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Rodong missiles, developed from Soviet-era Scud missiles, make up the bulk of the North's short- and medium-range missile arsenal with an estimated stockpile of 200.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Experts have predicted that the delivery vehicle for the North's first nuclear warhead would be the medium-range Rodong missile, rather than an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which the North has yet to test.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Despite threats to strike the mainland United States, the North is seen as several years away from building an ICBM that can carry a nuclear warhead.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Experts have previously said a functioning mid-range nuclear missile would need the technology to overcome the stress of launch and re-entry and to strike the target with precision, which requires repeated testing.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>The North fired a Rodong missile in March. It flew about 800 km (500 miles) into the sea, in the first such launch since two Rodongs were fired in 2014.  </p><span id="midArticle_15"/><span id="midArticle_16"/><p> (Editing by Tony Munroe, Robert Birsel)</p><span id="midArticle_17"/></div>
