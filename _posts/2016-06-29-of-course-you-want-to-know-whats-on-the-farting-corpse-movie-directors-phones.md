<br><div id="start-of-content"><p>The film is called <em>Swiss Army Man</em>, but if you’ve heard (or read) about it in the last six months, it was probably called something else: the <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/daniel-radcliffes-farting-corpse-movie-watch-the-swiss-army-man-trailer-video/" target="_blank">“farting corpse movie.”</a> And oddly, that’s an apt moniker. Well, mostly. (It has a lot of heart, but fewer people talk about that.) The short version is that it’s about a guy named Hank (Paul Dano) who is stranded in the wilderness and finds a corpse (Daniel Radcliffe) on a beach and uses its remaining bodily functions—flatulence included—for survival and companionship. (That’s why he’s a “Swiss army man”—get it?) Since one of the other things Hank finds while he’s lost is a barely-functioning smartphone, we decided to ask the movie’s writer-directors, the <a href="http://www.danieldaniel.us/" target="_blank">Daniels</a> (aka Daniel Scheinert and Daniel Kwan), what was on their cellular devices. Check out the video above to find out the last photos they took, texts they sent, and things they Googled. (Spoiler alert: It’s not always pretty.)  </p>
