                            <p>A few days before the House voted on a bipartisan deal to rescue Puerto Rico from its debt crisis, Speaker Paul Ryan caught wind of a problem.</p>
<p>Across the Capitol Rotunda, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid was quietly making a push with fellow Democratic negotiators in the Obama administration. The Nevada Democrat wanted to change the composition of an oversight board that would oversee the island territory’s debt restructuring, one of the most contentious pieces of the legislation.</p><p class="story-continued">Story Continued Below</p>

 <p>Ryan (R-Wis.) had already spent months trying to assemble a rescue package that Republicans, Democrats and the White House could sign off on. But he encountered one setback after another: His top negotiator, Natural Resources Chairman Rob Bishop (R-Utah), had to pull an initial draft after conservatives came out against it. Outside groups were running ads against Republicans warning against a “bailout” for the financially troubled territory. And Democrats were saying they couldn’t support the measure because of a minimum wage decrease, among other bill provisions.</p>
<p>So Ryan felt like he couldn’t yield on Reid’s point — or he’d lose Republican support and the bill would fail. He picked up the phone to call White House chief of staff Dennis McDonough, delivering a strong message: If you want this to pass the House, shut it down fast. They did.</p>
<p>Congress’ passage of a sweeping Puerto Rican rescue package is a significant victory in an otherwise rocky beginning for Ryan’s speakership. He personally steered negotiations between Republicans skittish of the “bailout” label and Democrats who abhorred the idea of an oversight board taking over the Caribbean island's finances. And it was Ryan who got the bill over the finish line after it looked like it was dead in the water, hammering out a deal with Treasury Secretary Jack Lew and White House chief of staff Dennis McDonough, while convincing his own conference to get on board.</p>
<p>Ryan also personally reached out to conservative pundits and skeptical Republicans to make the case. And he made a major push to educate his members, bringing in top Republicans to make the case for why the bill would actually protect taxpayer money. </p><aside class="story-related"><article class="story-frag format-sm"><figure class="thumb"><div class="fig-graphic">

    </article></aside><p>Ryan overcame a GOP conference that appeared to be in no mood to help the U.S. territory this spring: None of its members represent districts with big populations of Puerto Ricans, meaning they felt little public pressure to act. And the “yes” vote was achieved via "regular order," another boon for the speaker, who has advocated for legislation to go through committees with vigorous debate — even if it meant the chairman had to make two attempts at passage, as Bishop did. </p>
<p>“Through some amazing work by our Treasury Department, our legislative staff and a bipartisan effort in both the House and Senate, we finally have legislation that at least is going to give Puerto Rico the capacity, the opportunity to get out from under this lingering uncertainty with respect to their debt, and start stabilizing government services and to start growing again,” President Barack Obama said at a bill signing ceremony Thursday.</p>
<p>Ryan was badly in need of a win. Donald Trump drowned out the speaker’s big policy rollout this month, his first gambit to establish the House GOP as a pillar of serious thought in a party left adrift by Trump’s ascendance. And conservatives earlier in the year blocked Ryan from passing a budget, a major embarrassment for a former budget chairman who once blasted Democrats for failing to do the same.</p>
<p>One year ago, Puerto Rico’s governor, Alejandro Garcia Padilla, declared the island’s debts were unpayable. The territory is facing down $73 billion in debt.</p>
<p>On Capitol Hill, in the final weeks of 2015, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) personally phoned Ryan to implore him to do something soon, proposing he tuck a Puerto Rican rescue provision into a must-pass 2016 spending package.</p>
<p>But Ryan, staying true to what he’s said since taking the speaker’s gavel, insisted the legislation had to go through committee. Instead, he issued a December statement promising the House would act by the end of the first quarter of 2016.</p>
<p>That decision, however, almost imploded on him.</p>
<p>To begin with, one of the panels with jurisdiction over the bill, the House Judiciary Committee, was skittish to even address the issue. So Ryan and other GOP leaders convened a meeting early this year and decreed that Bishop's natural resources panel, which had proposed a compromise with the Obama administration that looked promising, would handle the Puerto Rico matter going forward.</p>
<p>That decision proved vital. And it’s emblematic of Ryan’s philosophy as speaker: Defer to the committees, but only if their proposals can work. </p>
<p>Still, it was hardly smooth sailing from there. Embarrassingly, Bishop had to pull the first draft of the bill from committee when it became apparent that he didn’t have the votes.</p>
<p>A series of outside groups thought to be funded by hedge funds with a financial stake in Puerto Rico, including the Center for Individual Freedom, had started airing TV and radio ads targeting conservatives on the panel back in their districts. The bill, the ads warned, was a “bailout” — a charge that would become a huge headache for Ryan, as his members recoiled at hearing the word.</p>
<p>Former Rep. Connie Mack (R-Fla.) also started getting involved, circulating a list of conservative groups and members he said were against the legislation. While several on the list did not in fact oppose it, and others ended up supporting the bill, the outside groups spooked lawmakers. </p>
<p>That kicked Ryan into high gear. He started an aggressive push to change the narrative, calling on Bishop and Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) to answer questions during a meeting of the House GOP conference. The duo explained why the bill wasn’t in fact a bailout and took questions to ease conservative lawmakers’ concerns.</p>
<p>Ryan also made phone calls to conservatives lawmakers, groups and pundits, telling them what the bill does and doesn’t do.</p>
<p>One outside group, Americans for Limited Government, even did an about-face on the matter. On April 14 it criticized Ryan for backing a "bailout." The very next day, the group issued a statement praising Ryan for putting out “a thoughtful approach to protect the U.S. taxpayers.”</p>
<p>The group would not say if Ryan had anything to do with its about-face.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bishop and committee staff, then negotiating a second bill with Treasury and House Democrats, hit a roadblock they couldn’t resolve. So, Ryan stepped in to get it over the hump, negotiating with Lew and McDonough.</p>
<p>One of the last sticking points dealt with the composition of the oversight board. The proposal gave the speaker and Senate majority leader two picks each to sit on the debt restricting oversight board. Their Democratic counterparts each got one, as did the president.</p>
<p>Republicans worried that Democrats and Obama would draw out the clock until 2017, when the Democrats could control the Senate and get a majority of their choices on the board. Democrats wanted Ryan to remove a sunset provision that essentially killed the entire deal if the oversight board wasn’t picked by the start of the new Congress.</p><aside class="story-related"><article class="story-frag format-sm"><figure class="thumb"><div class="fig-graphic">

    </article></aside><p>Treasury, meanwhile, wanted to ensure that the debt relief actually worked. And House Democrats, led by Pelosi, were still eying a number of provisions they wanted to remove, including a controversial land transfer deal, and sought a commitment to direct the board to adequately fund pensions for workers on the island.</p>
<p>The two sides worked out a deal. Among the give and take: The sunset provision came out, but language saying the president must approve the board before the next Congress stayed in. Ryan also agreed to ax the land deal that Democrats abhorred. And Democrats secured language addressing the pension issue.</p>
<p>It still wasn't a done deal, though. After the agreement was hatched, Ryan needed to ensure the compromise wasn’t upended as it went through the same committee where the initial Puerto Rico legislation was scuttled.</p>
<p>So the day the panel marked up the new bill, Ryan cleared his schedule. He personally met with committee members who wanted to introduce amendments that would upset the deal, sending him and the White House back to the drawing board.</p> 
<p>One was a pitch by panel Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) that would have weakened the shield that the bill provides to protect Puerto Rico from lawsuits filed by creditors. The speaker also met with Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho), a Freedom Caucus member who is of Puerto Rican descent. Labrador backed the deal and was key to keeping the conservative caucus neutral on the matter.</p>
<p>Ryan also helped guide some of the Senate's work on the issue, recommending that McConnell bring in Duffy and Bishop to brief senators at a luncheon. McConnell’s office said the meeting helped bring GOP senators on board.</p>
<p>“The speaker did a great job getting a strong bill through the House and ensuring that Leader McConnell’s priorities of a strong control board with no bailouts remained in the bill,” said McConnell’s spokesman Don Stewart. “This was a good cooperative effort that resulted in a strong bill.”</p>
<p>Ryan did not attend the signing ceremony, but said in a statement that the legislation would help Puerto Rico head off a fiscal collapse "while protecting American taxpayers from a bailout of the territory."<br/></p>
