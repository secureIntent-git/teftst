<span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocation">WASHINGTON</span> U.S. housing starts unexpectedly fell in January likely as bad weather disrupted building projects in some parts of the country, in what could be</p></span><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>a temporary setback for the housing market.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Groundbreaking fell 3.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.099 million units, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Part of the decline in starts could be attributed to the snowstorms, which blanketed the Northeast last month. </p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>December's starts were revised down to a 1.143 million-unit rate from the previously reported 1.15 million-unit pace.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts rising to a 1.17 million-unit pace last month.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The report comes on the heels of a survey on Tuesday showing confidence among homebuilders fell in February amid concerns over "the high cost and lack of availability of lots and labor."</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Builders were less optimistic about current sales.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Still, the housing market fundamentals remain strong, with a tightening labor market starting to push up wage growth.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Though residential construction accounts for a small fraction of gross domestic product, the decline in starts at the beginning of the year suggests that an anticipated rebound in economic growth will be modest.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The economy grew at a 0.7 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter after consumer spending moderated and a strong dollar hurt exports.

        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Single-family starts tumbled 14.1 percent in Northeast and fell 3.8 percent in Midwest.
