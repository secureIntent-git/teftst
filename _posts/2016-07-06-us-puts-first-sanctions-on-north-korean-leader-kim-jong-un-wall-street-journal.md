<p>WASHINGTON—The U.S. for the first time imposed sanctions on North Korean leader <!--
        --> Kim Jong Un<!--
      --> as part of what U.S. officials said is an escalating campaign to attack his regime’s finances in retaliation for its nuclear-weapon and ballistic-missile tests.</p> <!--
      --> 
<!--
      --> <p>The Obama administration also blacklisted 10 other senior North Korea officials Wednesday for allegedly aiding Mr. Kim in running a nationwide system of prison camps, torture chambers and propaganda organs that keep the Northeast Asian country isolated.</p> <!--
      --> 
<!--
      --> <p>Senior U.S. officials said the White House is committed to pressuring Mr. Kim’s regime and making its senior officials international pariahs over the country’s dire human-rights record.</p> <p>Under a law passed in February, the State Department released a five-page report that identifies the principal leaders and organizations overseeing North Korea’s prisons. All now have been sanctioned by the Treasury Department, U.S. officials said.</p> <p>“Under Kim Jong Un, North Korea continues to inflict intolerable cruelty and hardship on millions of its own people, including extrajudicial killings, forced labor, and torture,” said the Treasury’s top sanctions official, <!--
        --> Adam Szubin.<!--
      --> He said the sanctions “highlight the U.S. government’s condemnation of this regime’s abuses and our determination to see them stopped.”</p> <p>North Korean leaders repeatedly have denied running any political prisons or labor camps.</p> <p>U.S. officials said the sanctioning of a head of state is unusual but not unprecedented. In recent years, the Treasury blacklisted the late Libyan leader, Col. <!--
        --> Moammar Gadhafi,<!--
      --> Zimbabwe’s President <!--
        --> Robert Mugabe,<!--
      --> and the deposed Liberian dictator, <!--
        --> Charles Taylor.<!--
      --></p> <p>The penalties freeze any assets the designated officials hold in dollars. They also bar Americans from doing business with them.</p> <p>U.S. officials said they believed that directly sanctioning Mr. Kim and his top security officials could have political, as well as financial, implications for the regime. </p> <p>“I think we have some evidence that more and more people in North Korea, including within the ruling regime, are conscious that the political situation on the Korean Peninsula may change at some point in their lifetimes,” said a senior U.S. official who helped assemble the report. “It sends a message to people within the North Korean regime, particularly at those lower- to mid-levels, that if you become involved in abuses like running concentration camps or hunting down defectors, we will know who you are and you will end up on a blacklist that leaves you at a significant disadvantage.”</p> <p>The U.S. and United Nations have intensified sanctions on North Korea since it tested a nuclear weapon in January, its fourth. Pyongyang has also tested ballistic missiles that the Obama administration believes are designed to eventually carry nuclear warheads.</p> <p>The U.N. Security Council <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-n-adopts-new-sanctions-against-north-korea-1456934616" class="icon none">passed its most expansive sanctions</a> on North Korea in March, specifically targeting its finance, mining and shipping industries. </p> <p>Last month, the Treasury designated North Korea’s entire financial system as a “<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-moves-to-cut-off-north-korea-from-banking-system-1464797927" class="icon none">primary money-laundering concern</a>”—an action that is aimed at making it tougher for Chinese firms to do business with Pyongyang.</p> <p>The State Department, in its report, describes Mr. Kim as overseeing a vast prison and domestic-spying operation that keeps North Korea’s roughly 25 million people under constant surveillance and subject to harassment. Between 80,000 and 120,000 North Korea are held in political prison camps, the State Department estimates.</p> <p>Mr. Kim allegedly oversees the apparatus through his position as first chairman of the National Defense Commission, North Korea’s most powerful military body. Other institutions involved include the ministries of State Security and of People’s Security, said the State Department.</p> <p>The Propaganda and Agitation Department is tasked with blocking any independent or foreign media from operation inside North Korea. The Reconnaissance General Bureau runs international intelligence operations, including kidnappings and assassinations, the State Department said.</p> <p>“We’ve made the judgment that [Mr. Kim] is ultimately responsible for the actions of his regime,” said the senior U.S. official.</p> <p> <strong>Write to </strong>Jay Solomon at <a href="mailto:jay.solomon@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">jay.solomon@wsj.com</a> </p>
