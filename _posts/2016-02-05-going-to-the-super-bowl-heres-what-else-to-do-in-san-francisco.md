<br><div id="start-of-content"><p class="no-marg">San Francisco’s NFL team is the 49ers, named after the miners of the 1849 gold rush. Back then, the gold was in <em>them thar hills</em>, but today, it’s in the Valley. So it’s no surprise the City by the Bay has developed increasingly close ties to its peninsular brethren. When the Bay Area hosts the 50th Super Bowl in February, the celebration will span the entire region—from the city proper’s 49 square miles (OK, 46.9, but go Niners!) to the team’s new home in Santa Clara, an hour’s drive south. Completed in 2014, Levi’s Stadium is staffed by a group of techies who rove the stands to help guests use the Wi-Fi and a custom stadium app. (They’re called NiNerds, natch.)</p>

Contemplate the clouds at the <a href="http://deyoung.famsf.org/" target="_blank">de Young Museum</a> through <em>Three Gems</em>, a subterranean art installation by James Turrell that offers views of the sky enhanced by LEDs.
