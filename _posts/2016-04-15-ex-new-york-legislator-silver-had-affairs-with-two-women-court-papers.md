But a federal judge in Manhattan on Thursday ordered the disclosure, saying it was of public interest.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The documents showed that in October, prosecutors asked U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni to allow them to use evidence at trial about Silver's relationships, saying they were relevant to "the use of his official office for private benefit."</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>In a heavily redacted motion, prosecutors said one of the  women was a lobbyist who was often hired to lobby Silver on behalf of clients.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>During a recorded conversation on an unspecified date, Silver and the woman discussed how a reporter was calling legislators about whether certain legislators were having affairs, prosecutors said.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Silver responded: "I don't think he caught us."</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The second woman, according to prosecutors, had a "long-running extramarital relationship" with Silver, who used his official position to recommend her for a state job.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>The evidence about the affairs was ultimately not introduced at trial.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>In a joint statement, Silver's lawyers, Steven Molo and Joel Cohen, said: "These are simply unproven and salacious allegations that have no place in this case or public discussion."</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>One of the women, referred to in court papers as "Sealed Party A," was a "public figure," Caproni said at a hearing on Thursday. That woman hired a prominent lawyer, Abbe Lowell, to fight against having the papers made public.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Lowell did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Silver was first elected to the Assembly in 1976. He became its speaker in 1994 and held that position until after he was charged last year.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>A federal jury in December found Silver, 72, guilty on charges including fraud, extortion and money laundering. Prosecutors said at trial that he abused his office to collect as much as $4 million in illegal bribes and kickbacks.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Later in December, former New York Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos was convicted of bribery and extortion in a separate corruption case.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>As leaders of the state's two legislative houses, the Democrat Silver and the Republican Skelos were two-thirds of the "three men in a room," along with the governor, who exercise vast power over key legislation.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><span id="midArticle_16"/><p> (Reporting by Nate Raymond in New York; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)</p><span id="midArticle_17"/></div>
