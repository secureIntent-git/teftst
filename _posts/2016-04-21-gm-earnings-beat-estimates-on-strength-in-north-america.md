<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocation">DETROIT</span> General Motors Co on Thursday reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings, citing strong results in North America and an improved performance in Europe.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The automaker's shares were up 2.8 percent at $33.10 in early trading, about flat with their 2010 initial public offering price of $33 despite three straight quarters of record-breaking pretax profits. </p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra has stepped up efforts to persuade skeptical investors that GM can deliver consistently strong profits - and return billions to shareholders - through the ups and downs of the industry's sales cycles.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>First-quarter net income more than doubled to $2 billion, or $1.24 a share.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Excluding a one-time expense for litigation settlements, earnings were $1.26 a share, well ahead of analysts' expectations of $1.00. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The company said pretax income, excluding one-time items, was a record for the first quarter.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>GM said it still expected full-year earnings of $5.25 and $5.75 a share, excluding special items, up from $5.02 in 2015.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Revenue for the first quarter rose 4.5 percent to $37.3 billion. Adjusted profit margins increased to 7.1 percent of revenue from 5.8 percent a year earlier.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>North America accounted for 85 percent of GM's earnings before interest and taxes, reflecting robust profits from sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Margins from the region, however, fell to 8.7 percent from 8.8 percent a year earlier. Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens attributed the decline to restructuring costs and more U.S. union members taking packages to retire.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Stevens said the company still expected North American margins of more than 10 percent for 2016.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>In Europe, GM broke even, reversing a year-earlier loss of $200 million. </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Stevens affirmed the company's target for 8 percent profit margins in Europe over the next several years, but said the possibility that the United Kingdom will leave the European Union is a concern. "What does that do to pound sterling?" he said. "What does that do to business, and business transactions?" </p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>The automaker narrowed losses in South America. Income from joint ventures in China was flat at $500 million for the quarter.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><span id="midArticle_15"/><p> (Reporting by Joseph White and Bernie Woodall; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Lisa Von Ahn)</p><span id="midArticle_16"/></div>
