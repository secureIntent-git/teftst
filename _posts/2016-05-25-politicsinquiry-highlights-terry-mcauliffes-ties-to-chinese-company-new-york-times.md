        <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="276" data-total-count="2766" id="story-continues-3">Speaking to reporters in Virginia on Tuesday, Mr. McAuliffe said he was shocked by reports of an inquiry. He had played no role in soliciting Mr. Wang’s pledge to the Clinton Foundation and said the contributions to his campaign from by Mr. Wang’s company were legitimate.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="96" data-total-count="2862">“I’m very confident this gentleman had been fully vetted,” Mr. McAuliffe said of Mr. Wang.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="368" data-total-count="3230">But the federal inquiry throws a cloud over Mr. McAuliffe at a critical time: He is a top fund-raiser for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/hillary-clinton-on-the-issues.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Hillary Clinton." class="meta-per">Hillary Clinton</a>, a close confidant of her and her husband, and the governor of a swing state critical to her chances of becoming president. On Sunday, Mr. McAuliffe headlined a $5,000-a-head Virginia fund-raising event for Mrs. Clinton’s presidential campaign.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="457" data-total-count="3687">Mr. McAuliffe and Mr. Wang are, in a sense, mirror images: wealthy self-made men with intertwined careers in business and politics. Before becoming governor, Mr. McAuliffe was an inveterate deal-maker involved in everything from real estate to banking to <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/electric_vehicles/index.html?&amp;inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about electric vehicles." class="meta-classifier">electric cars</a>.

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="354" data-total-count="4794" id="story-continues-4">From 2012 to the end of last year, according to federal records, Mr. Wang’s companies paid $1.5 million to McGuireWoods Consulting to lobby on trade and visa issues. Dandong’s lobbyists included Jim Hodges, the former South Carolina governor. In 2012, Mr. Hodges arranged meetings with governors for Mark T. Fung, who was Dandong’s general counsel.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="414" data-total-count="5208">Mr. Wang also met with Mr. McAuliffe before he ran for governor, at a 2012 dinner hosted by Mr. Hodges. Mr. McAuliffe was an American businessman investing in China; Mr. Wang was a Chinese executive whose firms did business in Virginia. The next year, when Mr. McAuliffe ran for governor, one of Mr. Wang’s companies, West Legend, contributed to his campaign. (Corporate contributions are permitted in Virginia.)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="510" data-total-count="5718">But records and interviews reveal that Mr. Wang’s companies have had numerous reasons to seek the favor of United States government officials. Among Mr. Wang’s ventures are importing and crushing soybeans. In late 2012, his company entered negotiations to buy a privately owned port on the Mississippi River in Arkansas. The negotiations led to a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which includes representatives of the departments of State, Commerce and Homeland Security.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="342" data-total-count="6060">A letter from Rilin, one of Mr. Wang’s companies, to the American Embassy in Beijing, obtained by The New York Times, says that company representatives met with then-Gov. Mike Beebe of Arkansas while negotiating that deal, which was worth $27 million. Reached on Tuesday, Mr. Beebe said he did not remember ever having met with the company.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="229" data-total-count="6289">The foreign investment committee approved the deal in April 2013, but it ultimately fell through. Mr. Wang’s company complained that a delegation of Chinese nationals the company wanted to review the port had been denied visas.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="95" data-total-count="6384">About that same time, McGuireWoods contacted the American Embassy to discuss “visa issues.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="376" data-total-count="6760">Later that year, Gary Locke, then the United States’ ambassador to China, and the United States consul general in Shenyang met with Rilin in Dandong, according to a <a href="http://english.dandongport.com/2013/12/11/5457.shtml">news release</a> issued by the Dandong Port, which said the company had obtained a “group visa” making it more convenient for employees to travel to the United States “for business and education purposes.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="170" data-total-count="6930">Reached on Tuesday, Mr. Locke, who is a lawyer in Seattle, said that he remembered visiting Dandong, but added that there was no such thing as a group visa for a company.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="223" data-total-count="7153">Mr. Wang’s agricultural business also extended to Virginia. In 2011, <a href="https://votesmart.org/public-statement/637581/governor-mcdonnell-announces-soybean-export-business-agreements-between-perdue-agribusiness-and-chinas-dandong-port-group#.V0SscfkrK70">Gov. Bob McDonnell announced</a> that Perdue Agribusiness had agreed with Mr. Wang’s company to export soybeans through Perdue’s port in Chesapeake, Va.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="214" data-total-count="7367">In a statement, a spokeswoman for Mr. Wang said: “West Legend does business in Virginia and supports Gov. McAuliffe’s jobs-creation agenda. Its political contributions comply with all federal and state laws.”</p><a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#whats-next">Continue reading the main story</a>
