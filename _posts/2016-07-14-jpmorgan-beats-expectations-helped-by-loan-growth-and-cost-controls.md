<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocatio&lt;/span&gt;n">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (<span id="symbol_JPM.N_0">JPM.N</span>) reported a marginally lower second-quarter profit on Thursday but still beat subdued analyst expectations, helped by loan growth and a tight control on operating expenses.</span></p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The biggest U.S. bank by assets said its profit slipped 1 percent versus the same period a year earlier, as it set aside more money to meet future loan losses.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>However, its earnings per share of $1.55 handsomely beat the average analyst estimate of $1.43 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Analysts have reduced their forecasts for big banks in recent weeks.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>JPMorgan shares were 1.8 percent higher in premarket trading.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The bank's average book of core loans during the quarter – those related to ongoing businesses it plans to maintain – grew 16 percent, with particular expansion in mortgages and commercial real estate. Even as deposits grew, the portion it lent out also rose to 66 percent, compared with 61 percent a year ago and 64 percent in the prior quarter.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>At the same time, JPMorgan managed to keep down costs, apart from technology, with overall operating expenses dropping 6 percent compared with the year-earlier period.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Overall, JPMorgan's second-quarter net income slipped to $6.20 billion in the second quarter ended June 30 from $6.29 billion a year earlier. Net revenue rose 3 percent to $25.21 billion from $24.53 billion.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>JPMorgan is the first U.S. bank to announce results for the quarter, as well as the first to report since Britain voted on June 23 to leave the European Union.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>The vote to leave the EU, known as Brexit, helped capital markets revenue at JPMorgan. Investors scrambled to react to the vote, leading to big trading volumes in certain markets. The bank's fixed-income trading revenue soared 35 percent during the quarter.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>But Brexit also threw into doubt the likelihood of a U.S. interest rate hike anytime soon, meaning that lending margins will remain under pressure.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Although JPMorgan said it benefited from higher rates compared with the second quarter of 2015, its net interest margin declined from the previous quarter.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Another symptom of the bank's struggle with low rates was its return on tangible common equity, a key measure of profitability. The ratio fell to 13 percent from 14 percent a year earlier. Management has said it should be about 15 percent, but to get there, the bank needs higher interest rates.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>The Federal Reserve last raised U.S. rates in December, by 0.25 percentage points, after keeping them near zero for almost a decade.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>At the start of the year, it was widely expected that there would be two U.S. rate hikes this year. Now, Wall Street's top banks are almost evenly split on whether the Fed will raise rates at all this year, according to a Reuters poll.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Wells Fargo &amp; Co (<span id="symbol_WFC.N_1">WFC.N</span>) and Citigroup Inc (<span id="symbol_C.N_2">C.N</span>) the third- and fourth-biggest U.S. banks, report results on Friday.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><span id="midArticle_16"/><p> (Reporting by Sweta Singh in Bengaluru and David Henry in New York; Writing by Lauren Tara LaCapra; Editing by Ted Kerr and Chizu Nomiyama)</p><span id="midArticle_17"/></div>
