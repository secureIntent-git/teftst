But Nihar missed his follow-up words, which put Jairam back in contention.</p><p>The spellers will take home $40,000 in cash and other prizes.</p><p>Both Jairam and Nihar said they knew some of the words they were given and figured out the spelling of the rest.</p><p>Jairam is the younger brother of 2014 co-champion, Sriram Hathwar. He said the best advice he got from his brother was not to get too agitated if he was given a word he didn’t know. He plans on saving his winnings to pay for college.</p><p>Ten contestants made it to the finals and competed for the title of national champion before a live television audience. The finals were broadcast on ESPN.</p><p>The bee began Tuesday with 284 contestants but was pared to 45 Wednesday evening, after a written test and two rounds of onstage spelling.</p><p>By Thursday afternoon, the field had been further narrowed to the 10 finalists, who came from California, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Massachusetts, New York and Texas.</p><p>Five finalists made a return trip to the bee, which took place at Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center, just outside of Washington.</p><p>Mitchell Robson had a simple request as he nervously walked to the microphone Round 8 Thursday night.</p><p>“You need to give me a word I know – please,” the 14-year-old from Marblehead, Mass. Pleaded.</p><p>“I’ll try to work with you,” pronouncer Jacques Bailly joked.</p><p>Maybe it was karma, or maybe his plea actually worked. Whatever the explanation, Mitchell had no trouble spelling “esquisse,” which refers to a first, usually rough sketch. The crowd cheered as he returned to his seat.</p><p>But Robson’s victory was short-lived. A few minutes later, in Round 9, he misspelled “Wehrmacht” – which referred to the unified forces of Nazi Germany – and was eliminated from the competition.</p><p>Cooper Komatsu of Los Angeles was clearly nervous when it came his time to spell. He fidgeted. He stalled. But he conquered. He easily spelled “myoclonus,” which means an irregular, involuntary muscle contraction.</p><p>From “bailliage,” which refers to the authority of a medieval officer, to “kakiemon,” which is a Japanese decorated porcelain, spellers easily mastered a number of foreign tongue-twisters.</p><p>But Jashun Paluru, 11, of West Lafayette, Ind., was eliminated after stumbling over “vasopressin,” a hormone that increases blood pressure.</p><div id="module-position-PEI8ZG5qjEY" class="story-asset image-asset" readability="36"><aside itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="single-photo float" readability="12"><img itemprop="url" src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1464321490_796_National-spelling-bee-ends-in-a-tie-again-USA-TODAY.JPG" alt="Harshita Shet, 12, of White Plains, N.Y., works on" width="180" height="240" data-mycapture-src="" data-mycapture-sm-src=""/><meta itemprop="name" content="635998518789540953-beethursday.JPG"/><meta itemprop="height" content="240"/><meta itemprop="width" content="180"/><p>Harshita Shet, 12, of White Plains, N.Y., works on the spelling of "Stockholm" in Round 3 of the 2016 Scripps National Spelling Bee in National Harbor, Md., on May 25, 2016.<meta itemprop="copyrightHolder" content="Jack Gruber, USA TODAY NETWORK"/> <span class="credit">(Photo: Jack Gruber, USA TODAY NETWORK)</span></p></aside></div><p>Jashun asked if there were any alternate pronunciations.
