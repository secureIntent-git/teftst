<p>After a long drought of information and content after the release of last year’s expansion, Bungie and Activision have finally revealed the next big thing for their massively multiplayer shooter, <em>Destiny</em>. Unlike past expansions, this one will skip last-gen consoles and only be released on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. </p>
<p>It’s called <em>Rise of Iron</em>, and it’s a new expansion in the same vein as last year’s <em>The Taken King</em>. It’ll add a new zone to the game, the frost-covered Plaguelands, as well as a new endgame raid, new story missions, a three-player “Strike” mission (they’re like dungeons), and a new enemy faction in the form of a mutated version of the game’s first enemies, the insectoid scavengers called the Fallen. There will also be the usual growth for any expansion like this: new weapons, new gear, a higher level cap, etc. </p>
<p><em>Rise of Iron</em> will be out September 20 for $29.99, though you’ll need to already own <em>The Taken King</em> and the prior two expansions (along with the base game) to play it.</p>
