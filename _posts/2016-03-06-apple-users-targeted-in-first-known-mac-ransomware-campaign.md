The representative said he could not immediately provide other details. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The malware is programmed to encrypt files on an infected personal computer three days after the original infection, according to Olson.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>That means that if Apple's steps prove ineffective in neutralizing malware that has already infected Macs, the earliest victims will have their files encrypted on Monday, three days after the malicious program first appeared on the Tranmission website, he said.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>The Transmission site offers the open source software that was infected with the ransomware. </p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Palo Alto said it planned to release a blog advising Mac users on ways to check to see if they were infected with the virus and steps they can take to protect against it harming their data, Olson said. </p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Transmission is one of the most popular Mac applications used to download software, videos, music and other data through the BitTorrent peer-to-peer information sharing network, according to Olson. </p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Representatives with Transmission could not be reached immediately for comment. </p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>The project's website, www.transmissionbt.com, on Sunday carried a warning saying that version 2.90 of its Mac software had been infected with malware. </p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>It advised users to immediately upgrade to version 2.91 of the software, which was available on its website, or delete the malicious one.   </p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>It also provided technical information on how users could check to see if they were affected.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><span id="midArticle_16"/><p> (Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)</p><span id="midArticle_17"/></div>
