<br><div id=""><p><strong>Ken Howard</strong>, a popular character actor on the stage and screen — he won a Tony in 1970 for <em>Child's Play</em> and recently appeared on the TV series <em>30 Rock</em> and in the films <em>The Judge</em> and <em>Joy</em> — <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ken-howard-dead-white-shadow-851531" target="_blank">died on Wednesday</a> at the age of 71. He was the sitting president of SAG-AFTRA, the largest union of actors, and appeared on the 22nd SAG Awards in January. Howard's cause of death has not been disclosed, but he was diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer in 2007 and was recently hospitalized with a case of shingles.</p>&#13;
<p>Here, friends and colleagues from the show business community share remembrances of Howard.</p>&#13;
<p>* * *</p>&#13;
<p><strong>George Clooney</strong></p>&#13;
<p>"There’s a story about how a young actor met Ken on the Fox lot in 1983 and told him what a fan he was of <em>The White Shadow</em>. Ken asked that actor what he did and the young man said, 'Well, someday I hope to be lucky enough to work with you.' Then he told Ken he had an audition all the way across town at Paramount but he wasn't going to make it because all he had was a bike. So Ken put his bike in the trunk of his car and dropped him off at Paramount. Then Ken just waved goodbye and said good luck, 'I hope we do get that chance to work together.' I didn’t get that audition, But I did get the chance to work with him years later. It was an honor. Today his obituary read that he was six foot six, but he was so much taller than that."</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p><strong>Alec Baldwin</strong></p>&#13;
<p>"I had known Ken most of my career, as I always remember <em>White Shadow</em> as a big hit on CBS. Later on, when he became president of SAG, I would see him regularly at the SAG awards. Ken was a great union leader and he made me proud to serve as SAG Ambassador for a couple of years. When Ken showed up on the <em>30 Rock</em> set to play Hank Hooper, the owner of Kabletown, he reminded us all of just how funny he was. He nailed it. So often, union leaders lose a good part of their career as performers. Ken showed up, the head of SAG, and killed us with his take on the character and his timing. He was smart, talented and a doll to work with."</p>&#13;
<p><strong>David O. Russell</strong></p>&#13;
<p>"Ken Howard was a bit of a hero to me since high school back east because a kid I knew got a role on <em>The White Shadow</em>, acted with Ken, said what a good guy he was and we all watched the show. He was a terrific actor and person, I'm grateful we got to work with him for a day on <em>Joy</em> and he was a very good SAG president. I'm sad for him to be gone so soon."</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Robert Duvall</strong></p>&#13;
<p><span><span style="background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">"Ken was a really decent and talented man.</span></span> <span style="background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">We had wonderful conversations. At any time of the day you could approach him and have a welcome visit and talk about any subject that came up. It was a pleasure to be around him. </span><span><span style="background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">I enjoyed very much working with him on <em>The Judge</em>."</span></span></p>&#13;
<p><strong>Gabrielle Carteris, SAG-AFTRA acting president</strong></p>&#13;
<p>"Ken was an inspirational leader and it is an incredible loss for SAG-AFTRA, for his family and for everyone who knew him. He was a light that never dimmed and was completely devoted to the membership. He led us through tumultuous times and set our union on a steady course of excellence. We will be forever in his debt."</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Paris Barclay, DGA President</strong></p>&#13;
<p>"It is with great sadness that we learned of the passing of Ken Howard, president of our sister guild SAG-AFTRA. Ken was an industry leader whose passion was channeled in his selfless work to protect the rights of performers. His strong leadership of SAG-AFTRA through the merger was an inspiration to our industry. Above all, Ken was a man of integrity, honor and unmatched spirit. He will be greatly missed. Our thoughts are with his wife Linda, his friends and the entire SAG-AFTRA family at this difficult time."</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Howard Rodman, WGA-West president</strong></p>&#13;
<p>"It was with great sadness that I learned of Ken Howard’s passing today. He was a tireless advocate for social justice, for his union, and for its members. It is a fitting tribute to his commitment to improving the lives of actors, broadcasters and recording artists that he was the first president of the united SAG-AFTRA. He will be missed as a leader and as a bright light in the creative community. On behalf of the WGAW I would like to send our condolences to his family, his friends, and all those whose lives he touched throughout his long and exemplary career."</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Lowell Peterson, WGA-East executive director</strong></p>&#13;
<p>"Ken Howard was unfailingly attentive and engaged. His legacy is embedded in the merger of SAG-AFTRA and brilliant television shows from <em>The White Shadow</em> to <em>30 Rock</em>. We send our condolences to his family and friends."</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers</strong></p>&#13;
<p>"We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Ken Howard.  Anyone who ever met Ken knew of his devotion to acting and to his fellow actors.  Even as he achieved success in his own acting career, he never lost sight of the need to advocate for working actors.  At the bargaining table, Ken spoke sparingly, but eloquently and intelligently, in support of improvements in working conditions for actors.  It was no surprise that Ken became the leader of the movement to unite SAG and AFTRA, something that had twice been attempted — and twice failed — before he became President of the Screen Actors Guild. It took someone with his forceful personality, considerable intelligence and immutable commitment to the betterment of working actors, broadcasters and recording artists to unite them in a single union.  This, together with his remarkable portrayals of characters on stage and screen, will become his enduring legacy — one fitting for such a remarkable man. We will miss him greatly."</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Eric Garcetti, Mayor of </strong><strong>Los Angeles  </strong></p>&#13;
<p>"Ken Howard was a friend and an impactful leader who dedicated himself to improving the lives of union workers and fighting for everyday people in our city. His commitment to supporting artists, and encouraging creativity in young people, helped countless Angelenos jump-start successful careers in the entertainment industry. His influence and work will live on, and we will miss him dearly."</p>&#13;
