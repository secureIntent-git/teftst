<br><div id=""><p>Actor Anton Yelchin, known for his roles in indie films such as <em>Like Crazy</em> and <em>Star Trek Into Darkness</em>, died early this morning in a seemingly fluke accident. He was 27.</p>
<p>The actor was apparently pinned between his car and a brick mailbox, <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2016/06/19/star-trek-anton-yelchin-dead/" target="_blank">according to TMZ</a>, which first reported the news. In a <a href="http://variety.com/2016/film/news/anton-yelchin-dead-star-trek-alpha-dog-1201798798/" target="_blank">statement to <em>Variety</em></a>, a representative for Yelchin said he was “killed in a fatal traffic collision early this morning. His family requests you respect their privacy at this time.”</p>
<p>Yelchin most recently appeared in the indie horror flick <em>Green Room</em>, but before that had acted in a range of movies from indies like <em>Only Lovers Left Alive</em> to blockbusters like J.J. Abrams’ <em>Star Trek</em> and <em>Star Trek Into Darkness</em>, for which he took on the role of Chekov. He had just completed work on <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/05/justin-lin-star-trek-beyond/">Justin Lin</a>’s <em>Star Trek Beyond</em>.</p>
<p>“I loved Anton Yelchin so much,” his <em>Star Trek</em> co-star John Cho, <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnTheCho/status/744599095348625408" target="_blank">tweeted</a>. “He was a true artist—curious, beautiful, courageous. He was a great pal and a great son. I’m in ruins.”</p>
<p>As news of his passing spread, others began to share their thoughts on the actor’s tragic passing.</p>
