				<p>If there’s one scene we wish had been in the film, it’s this one—which actually isn't available on the Blu-ray, but only on last week's Digital HD release. How did Han, Finn, Chewie, and Maz get out of the basement where Finn received Luke’s light saber? Fight their way through a Stormtrooper unit, it turns out—but not before Han reels off some excellent quips. First he calls Supreme Leader Snoke “Smoke,” and then wonders aloud, “What makes him Supreme?” It also helps show how Han recognized Finn wasn’t who he said he was (his boots), and it’s a much funnier Close Call than the one with Han and the smuggler gangs earlier in the film.</p>
