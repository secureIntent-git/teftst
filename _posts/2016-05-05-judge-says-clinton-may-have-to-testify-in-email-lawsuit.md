        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Critics, including likely Republican presidential election rival Donald Trump, say she endangered government secrets and evaded transparency laws but the former first lady denies any wrongdoing.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Judicial Watch brought a lawsuit against the State Department to gain access to records related to a Clinton aide's employment. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is also probing her email arrangement.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>"This is a very great victory for transparency and, despite the best efforts of the Obama administration and the Clinton camp, it looks like we might finally get some answers under oath about the Clintons' illicit email system," said Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch.       </p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Sullivan gave Judicial Watch permission to take testimony from close Clinton aide Huma Abedin and others.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
