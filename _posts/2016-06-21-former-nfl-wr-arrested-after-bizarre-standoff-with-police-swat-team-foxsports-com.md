<p>Former NFL wide receiver Davone Bess was arrested early Monday after fleeing a traffic stop and then barricading himself in his home, <a adhocenable="false" href="http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/gilbert/2016/06/20/gilbert-man-arrested-after-early-morning-standoff/86141490/" target="_blank">The Arizona Republic reports</a>.</p>

<p>Bess, 30, reportedly left the traffic stop in Gilbert, Ariz., around midnight and then barricaded himself in a car. He then ran into his home, from which he eventually was apprehended after police and a SWAT team obtained a search warrant.</p>

<p>He was charged with endangerment, felony flight and failure to stop for a police officer -- all felonies.</p>



<p>It isn't the first run-in with the law for Bess, whose bizarre behavior eventually led to his release from the Browns. <a adhocenable="false" href="http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2014/03/cleveland_browns_release_troub.html" target="_blank">Cleveland.com notes</a> that Bess was ultimately cut loose in March of 2014 after he was arrested in the Ft. Lauderdale airport for assaulting a police officer, after spilling coffee on the officer who questioned why he was "dancing and singing as his pants repeatedly fell down." During his tenure in Cleveland, Bess also was hospitalized for irrational behavior and spent time on the non-football illness list because of emotional distress.</p>

<p>Bess made his NFL debut with the Miami Dolphins in 2008 and spent five seasons with them before joining the Cleveland Browns in 2013 -- his final season in the league. He had his best season in 2010 when he caught 79 passed for 820 yards and five touchdowns. Â </p>
