Salesforce's earnings were of particular interest to investors in the technology sector because the quarter goes through January, a month when other technology companies have said they started to see signs of weakness.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Salesforce painted a brighter picture, highlighting new or expanded deals with customers such as Charles Schwab, the financial-services company, and consumer-goods maker Unilever.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"Now, we read the same newspapers as everybody else," said Chief Financial Officer Mark Hawkins on a call with analysts. "We aren't seeing an economic impact."</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Part of the reason, executives said on the call, was that Salesforce often skipped over the information technology department, an area where flat spending is expected this year, and sold to other departments.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Some technology companies that have flagged potential weakness this year sell infrastructure equipment or other products that typically fall under an IT budget.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>

He said Salesforce's software has helped the company expand by a "factor of 10" compared with the spreadsheet based system it replaced.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Eric Scollard, global sales head for IT analytics company ExtraHop, made similar comments. "It helps us understand which campaigns drive more sales," he said.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The company raised its full-year revenue forecast to $8.08 billion-$8.12 billion, from $8.0 billon-$8.1 billion, and said forecast adjusted profit of 99 cents to $1.01 per share.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 99 cents per share on revenue of $8.08 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>In the fourth quarter ended Jan. 31, revenue from sales cloud - a suite of software that allows companies to track leads, forecast and collaborate around sales opportunities - rose 12.3 percent to $708.9 million.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
