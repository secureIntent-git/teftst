							<p>Steve Pikiell turned Stony Brook from a punching bag to a mid-major power. That will look like a walk in the park compared to his next challenge: Making Rutgers a winner.</p>
<p>The 48-year-old Stony Brook coach has agreed to become Rutgers’ next men’s basketball coach, a source confirmed. Pikiell still needs to be approved by the school’s Board of Governors next week, according to the Asbury Park Press. NJ.com was first to report the hire by new Rutgers athletic director Pat Hobbs.</p>
<p>Pikiell was reportedly Rutgers’ third choice, after Rhode Island coach Danny Hurley and George Washington’s Mike Lonergan took their names out of the search. Iona’s Tim Cluess was another candidate, according to sources.</p>
<p>A source close to Pikiell said he met with Rutgers’ hierarchy Saturday morning after returning to Long Island late Friday night following Thursday’s loss to Kentucky.</p>
<p>“He thinks it’s a great opportunity. He knows all the issues, all the shortcomings,” the source said. “Coming from Stony Brook, doing what he’s done this year, this is the next step for him.”</p>
<p>Pikiell compiled a 190-155 mark in 11 seasons at Stony Brook and a 24-6 record this year, which included the Seawolves’ first NCAA Tournament berth. He has won at least 22 games five of the past six years, after inheriting the program that just recently had moved into the Division I ranks and had just one winning season the 12 years before his arrival. His teams were well-coached and strong defensively, the America East’s premier program the last five years.</p>

Rutgers’ last winning season was in 2005-06, and the Scarlet Knights haven’t reached the NCAA Tournament since 1991.</p>
<p>Pikeill was a two-year captain as a player at Connecticut, part of a Huskies team from 1987-91 that won their first Big East title and reached the Elite Eight and Sweet 16. He also worked under Hall of Fame coach Jim Calhoun from 1991-92 before spending time as an assistant at Yale, Central Connecticut and George Washington prior to landing the Job at Stony Brook in 2005.</p>
<p>“Clearly, he’s had a few opportunities before. He’s called me about them, but now I would think there will be more opportunities,” Calhoun told Newsday this week. “As a coach and a person, he checks all the boxes.”</p>
<p>Pikiell will need to hire a strong staff to recruit at the Big Ten level. It’s uncertain if he will bring any of his assistants with him from Stony Brook. Associate head coach Jay Young is a candidate to take over at Stony Brook, and he could keep Rutgers assistant Greg “Shoes” Vetrone, who brought in freshman point guard Corey Sanders and junior college forward DeShawn Freeman, the two most talented players on Rutgers’ roster. Stony Brook assistant Dan Rickard also has developed a reputation as a strong recruiter in the northeast.</p>
