Democrats have accused the Republicans of historic obstructionism and of ignoring their constitutional obligations.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The Republicans insist that the next president, to be elected on Nov. 8 and take office Jan. 20, fill the vacancy, hoping a Republican will win the White House race and choose a conservative rather than the centrist Garland.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
