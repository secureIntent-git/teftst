								<p>Watch out, Netflix. Amazon is offering monthly video subscriptions now too.</p>
<p>Amazon’s wildly popular Amazon Prime just went monthly, a move that pits the service in direct competition to streaming video rivals Netflix and Hulu.</p>
<p>Now customers have the option to sign on to a standalone version of Amazon’s streaming video service for $8.99 a month. They can also sign up for full Amazon Prime by the month, a service that offers streaming movies and shows plus perks like faster shipping rates, music, e-books, and other benefits for $10.99 a month. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DBYBNEE?_encoding=UTF8&amp;*Version*=1&amp;*entries*=0">new service options</a> went live on Amazon late Sunday, <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/18/business/amazon-challenges-netflix-by-opening-prime-to-monthly-subscribers.html?ref=technology">The New York Times</a></em> reports.</p>
<p>Annual prime membership, at $99 a year, is still a better deal for customers, who would save about $9 over the new monthly streaming video plan, or $33 versus a year of the monthly Prime subscriptions.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><a href="http://fortune.com/getdatasheet/">Get Data Sheet</a>, </em>Fortune’s<em> technology newsletter.</em></p>
<p>With an estimated 54 million U.S. members, Amazon Prime already beats out Netflix when it comes to its subscribers: Netflix has about <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/04/12/netflix-best-original-content-morgan-stanley/">45 million eyeballs tuned in</a> to its content across the country.</p>
<p>The new month-to-month subscriptions are just one way Amazon is expanding its subscription offerings, hoping to lure more customers onto its site. Last month, the company <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/03/22/amazon-sells-comcast-tv-internet/">partnered with Comcast</a> <span class="tickershortcode quotecard_hook unprocessed neutral" data-symbol="cmcsa">

			</span> to offer cable, Internet, and phone subscriptions via the Amazon Cable Store. Amazon has also been growing its <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/04/15/amazon-netflix-movie-theaters/">investments in movies</a>, nabbing a string of film rights recently, including Woody Allen’s next rom-com, for a reported $20 million.</p>
