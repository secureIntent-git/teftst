The other officers had previously pleaded guilty, court records show.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>An all-white jury deliberated for less than two hours, the Ocala Star-Banner newspaper reported, noting that the officers involved were also white. Terrell's defense argued that they were dealing with a potentially violent suspect, it reported.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/>

        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The victim was left bloodied in a parking lot where he was apprehended, after fleeing when authorities initially came to execute a drug-related arrest warrant. A video recording showed that he had raised his hands in the air, and he was lying facedown on the concrete, before any officers reached him.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
