            </figcaption></figure><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="205" data-total-count="205">The contestants rolled up their sleeves and took to their plates of hot dogs on the stage, lining up their cups of water in a strategic array, as thousands of perspired onlookers watched with anticipation.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="225" data-total-count="430">As the countdown ended, the reigning champion burst into action, hot dogs disappearing faster than the eye wanted to see, with only a pause given for a wipe of the mouth, or an occasional flip of her blond hair from her face.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="217" data-total-count="647">“This is back and forth, neck and neck, dog for dog,” said George Shea, the longtime M.C. of the Nathan’s Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, gesturing to the two leading eaters. “Both with ponytails, I love it.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="228" data-total-count="875">For decades, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/04/nyregion/public-lives-just-a-pr-stunt-ok-you-try-eating-50-hot-dogs.html">men have flocked</a> to Coney Island on the Fourth of July to test their stomachs and their will against <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/05/nyregion/05hotdog.html">the likes</a> of Takeru Kobayashi and Joey Chestnut, and scarf down the most Nathan’s Famous hot dogs in 10 minutes.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="246" data-total-count="1121">The competition on Monday was no different. But before Mr. Chestnut took the first of his many winning bites, before the green confetti fell and the cameras surrounded him and his competitors, a group of less celebrated women tried the same feat.</p><div id="story-ad-1" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="330" data-total-count="1451" id="story-continues-1">The reigning champion, Miki Sudo of Las Vegas, bounced up and down at center stage next to the three-time women’s champion, Sonya Thomas, known as the Black Widow. Ms. Thomas did less bouncing; she favored the time-honored technique of dunking her hot dog buns in cups of water before stuffing them into her mouth with her fist.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="312" data-total-count="1763">The crowd and ceremonial glitter were milder than they would be an hour later for the men’s competition, and the numbers didn’t mount as high as Mr. Chestnut’s total of 70 hot dogs, but the chewing was equally engrossing. Ms. Sudo ultimately devoured 38.5 hot dogs in 10 minutes, beating Ms. Thomas’s 35.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="243" data-total-count="2006">Before 2011, women competed alongside the men in the same hot dog eating contest. The new separate contest provides for a fairer competition, female competitors said, but often seems overshadowed by the media’s focus on the men’s division.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="104" data-total-count="2110">“To be dismissed as an opening act,” Ms. Sudo said before the contest began, “is disappointing.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="274" data-total-count="2384">Ms. Sudo’s hot dog tally beat the fourth-place total in the men’s division, 38 hot dogs, and last year, her result would have placed her third over all, she said. Yet far more reporters and fans directed their attention toward the men’s competition than the women’s.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="126" data-total-count="2510">“It would be nice to be given equal coverage,” she said. “There are competitors that are just as dominant as the men.”</p><figure id="media-100000004510038" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000004510038 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/05/nyregion/05HOTDOG2/05HOTDOG2-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group"><span class="visually-hidden">Photo</span>

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="154" data-total-count="3065" id="story-continues-2">Among the 15 female contestants were a taxidermist, a long-haul truck driver, a marine mammal trainer, a hairdresser and a fashion model from New Zealand.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="347" data-total-count="3412">The women came prepared, having trained throughout the year, exercising and eating healthy to stay lean and limber — better, apparently, for expanding their stomach muscles. They practiced their techniques at smaller competitions around the country and world, devouring dozens of Twinkies in six minutes, or hundreds of shrimp won tons in eight.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="182" data-total-count="3594">“You have to be physically fit to stand up there for 10 minutes and go full force,” said Nela Zisser, the 24-year-old model from New Zealand, who also studies biomedical science.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="244" data-total-count="3838">The 5-foot-7, 110-pound woman wore her platinum-blond hair slicked back in a bun for the competition, her second at Coney Island. She said that in New Zealand, her friends were shocked when they heard about her international eating competition.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="77" data-total-count="3915">“They ask: ‘How do you do it? Where do you put it?’” Ms. Zisser said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="255" data-total-count="4170">Ms. Thomas, who holds the female world record of 45 hot dogs in 10 minutes, said many women were “too shy” to enter eating competitions. A Korean native, she said that for cultural reasons, her relatives sometimes frowned upon her eating competitions.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="59" data-total-count="4229">“It’s not pretty when you eat fast,” Ms. Thomas said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="268" data-total-count="4497">On the left side of the stage during the competition, one woman’s outfit stood out. Mary Bowers of Beverly Hills, Calif., wore a colorful tiered dress depicting a Nathan’s hot-dog stand, as well as a glittery hat with stacked hot dogs, ketchup and mustard bottles.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="134" data-total-count="4631">Ms. Bowers said she hoped the women’s competition would eliminate a cultural stigma that often discourages eating among young girls.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="128" data-total-count="4759">“For a woman to step on that stage in front of all those people and eat one bite is a huge accomplishment,” Ms. Bowers said.</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="209" data-total-count="4968" id="story-continues-3">Once the media frenzy began to wind down after the finish of the men’s competition, the champions of both contests, Ms. Sudo and Mr. Chestnut, sat together on the edge of the stage, sweaty, stuffed and worn.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="129" data-total-count="5097">Mr. Chestnut said he believed that women like Ms. Sudo could eat just as much as the men, and should get the credit they deserve.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="78" data-total-count="5175">“It just doesn’t seem ladylike,” he said. “I hope that will change.”</p><a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#whats-next">Continue reading the main story</a>
