It's time to stop delaying and come clean with the American people,‚Äù Cruz said in a statement.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Rubio released his last five years of federal returns on Saturday, while Cruz submitted four years.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Rubio said Trump, who has promoted his success as a businessman as one of his key qualifications for the presidency, may not be as wealthy as he suggests.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>"I think part of it is he's not as rich as he says he is," Rubio said while campaigning in Georgia.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Rubio and his wife have only one debt: the mortgage on their house, the campaign said, seeking to emphasize that the senator had moved past previous financial woes.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Rubio often refers to the nearly $150,000 in student loan debt he incurred by the time he graduated from law school, paid off with proceeds made from his 2012 autobiography.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>He also faced questions for struggling for several months in 2008 to pay the mortgage on his $384,000 South Florida home, despite a $300,000 salary from his job at a Miami law firm.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Rubio also drew scrutiny for liquidating a retirement account to cover expenses, such as home repairs and school fees. That was reflected in $68,241 of income as part of his 2014 return.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>During his 2010 bid for the U.S. Senate, which followed his stint as a Florida state lawmaker from 2005-2006, Rubio had to defend his use of a Republican Party-issued American Express credit card for more than $7,200 personal expenses, which he later paid back. </p><span id="midArticle_14"/>
