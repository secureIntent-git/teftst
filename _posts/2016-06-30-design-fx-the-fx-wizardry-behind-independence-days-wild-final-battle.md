<br><div id="start-of-content"><p>It’s been 20 years since the last <em>Independence Day</em> hit theaters. In that time, visual effects have evolved to the point where making huge real-looking aliens is a lot more plausible than it was back in 1996, when all we got was one half-visible alien at the controls of the mothership—and that extraterrestrial Will Smith punched in the face. So for <em>Independence Day: Resurgence</em>, director Roland Emmerich called on the team at Weta Digital to make a bigger, badder alien. The Weta team ended up doing more than 230 VFX shots just for the final battle scene alone. Find out how they did it in the <em>Design FX</em> video above. </p>
