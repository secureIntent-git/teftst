<p itemprop="articleBody">
Prime Minister <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/haider-al-abadi.htm" class="r_lapi">Haider al-Abadi</a> fired Baghdad's security chief Friday following a series of attacks, including one at a Shiite shrine that killed 37 people and was claimed by militants from the Islamic State group.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
Anger against the government is running high among Iraqis following a large-scale car bombing Sunday that killed at least 186 people.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
That attack was followed Thursday night by mortar fire on the Sayyid Mohammed shrine and a nearby market in Balad, 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of the Iraqi capital.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
A suicide bomber first targeted police guarding the shrine's entrance. That allowed allowing a second bomber to push into the courtyard with nine gunmen who targeted security forces and civilians gathered inside to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, the holiday marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
A third bomber was killed before he detonated his explosives, police said.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
In all, 37 people were killed and 62 wounded, according to police and hospital officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
IS claimed responsibility for the shrine attack in a post on the internet. The Associated Press could not verify the authenticity of the statement, but it appeared on a website commonly used by the extremists.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
Al-Abadi fired the commander of <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/iraq/baghdad-iraq.htm" class="r_lapi">Baghdad</a> Operations, a statement from his office said, as the embattled prime minister faced growing protests stemming from Sunday's massive car bombing, one of the deadliest since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. The statement said other security and intelligence officials also were fired, but it did not identify them.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
Many Iraqis blame the political leadership for security lapses that allow such violence to happen in territory far from the front-line fighting against IS.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
Small-scale bombings occur on a near-daily basis in Baghdad. In May, a string of larger attacks, many of them claimed by IS, killed more than 200 people in a single week.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
After the Baghdad attack, al-Abadi announced new security measures, but it was unclear if any have been implemented.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
Interior Minister Mohammed Salem al-Ghabban submitted his resignation Tuesday, but al-Abadi has not accepted it.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
The Islamic State group was pushed out of <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/iraq/fallujah.htm" class="r_lapi">Fallujah</a> last month after holding the city just west of Baghdad for more than two years. Despite a series of defeats, IS militants still hold pockets of territory in northern and western Iraq, including the second-largest city of Mosul.</p>
