<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="6"><p><span class="articleLocation">CHICAGO</span> Illinois’ Republican governor and Democrat-led state legislature inched toward a possible breakthrough in their record-setting, yearlong budget impasse, but neither side would characterize a spending framework negotiated on Wednesday as an outright deal.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The state House and Senate were poised to take up budget bills on Thursday, including a significant increase in state and local contributions to Chicago Public Schools (CPS) teacher pensions. </p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Illinois is the only U.S. state without a complete budget for the fiscal year that ends at midnight Thursday.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The nation's fifth-largest state has limped through the year, relying on court-ordered spending and ongoing stopgap appropriations to operate in the wake of an impasse between the Republican governor and Democrats who control the legislature.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Marathon meetings Tuesday and Wednesday between Rauner and legislative leaders sparked optimism among some lawmakers of a possible deal to finally plug fiscal 2016 budget holes for public universities and social-service providers, as well as for a temporary fiscal 2017 spending plan and full-year funding for  K-12 schools.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>A provision under discussion would allow Chicago’s City Council to approve a $250 million property tax increase for teacher pensions, said state Senator Heather Steans, the chamber's Democratic point person on budgets. That possible increase would be on top of a $588 million phased-in property-tax hike authorized by the council last October to stabilize cash-starved city police and fire pension funds and to pay for school construction projects.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Legislation that surfaced late Wednesday in the House would commit an additional $205.4 million in state money to CPS pensions for fiscal 2017, $221 million in fiscal 2018 and unspecified amounts in subsequent years. That bill is expected to be altered to reflect a one-year funding commitment by Rauner and Republican lawmakers.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>The legislature ended its spring session on May 31 without passing a new budget, raising questions over Illinois' ability to operate for a second straight fiscal year without a spending plan. Passing budget bills now requires tougher-to-achieve three-fifths votes in each chamber.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>The proposed stopgap spending plan for the 2017 fiscal year beginning Friday would keep the state going only until January, leaving open the possibility the impasse could reignite over pro-business and union-weakening changes sought by Rauner.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Steans described the spending outline as a “tentative agreement” between Illinois’ feuding political parties. But none of the spokespersons for the governor and legislative leaders were willing to go so far on Wednesday night.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><span id="midArticle_11"/><p> (Reporting By Dave McKinney, additional reporting by Karen Pierog; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)</p><span id="midArticle_12"/></div>
