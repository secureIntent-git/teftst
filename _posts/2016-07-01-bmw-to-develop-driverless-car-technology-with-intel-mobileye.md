        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Sophisticated cruise control systems already enable "hands off" driving as cameras and computers allow cars to automatically brake, steer and accelerate in traffic at low speeds. But drivers are required to stay in control. </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Now the auto industry wants to develop higher levels of automation described as "eyes off," "mind off," and "driver off" cruising.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>This requires much more computing power and software know-how, forcing traditional carmakers to collaborate more closely with technology specialists.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Auto camera and software maker Mobileye said it would supply its Road Experience Management (REM) technology to the alliance and make its latest EyeQ5 chip available to be deployed on Intel computing platforms.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>The three companies said they would demonstrate their technology in a prototype in the near future. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/><span id="midArticle_9"/><p> (Reporting by Edward Taylor; Editing by Mark Potter)</p><span id="midArticle_10"/></div>
