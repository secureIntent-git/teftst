(<a href="http://bit.ly/1KvrmZ5">bit.ly/1KvrmZ5</a>)</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Twitter's announcement comes as many tech companies – led by Facebook – have taken stronger steps to police controversial content online in the face of threats from legislators to force the companies to report "terrorist activity" on their sites to law enforcement.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Silicon Valley has been wary of engaging with government officials, concerned about endless demands for similar action from countries around the world as well as fears about being perceived by consumers as tools of government.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The announcement was also notable because Twitter has said little about its efforts to combat Islamic State, also known as ISIS, and similar groups even though it has been criticized for not doing enough.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Islamic State, which controls last swathes of Iraq and Syria, has heavily relied on the 300 million-person site, as well as others, to recruit fighters and propagate violent messages.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Seamus Hughes, deputy director of George Washington University's program on extremism, said Friday's report showcased an "impressive number" of takedowns, but said that Twitter still appears to police extremist content in a mostly "episodic" way.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Many extremists have migrated toward smaller, less monitored platforms in recent months in response to major Silicon Valley firms stepping up their content policing, Hughes added. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>In January, a delegation of top national security officials met tech industry leaders from Twitter, Facebook Inc (<span id="symbol_FB.O_1">FB.O</span>), Apple Inc (<span id="symbol_AAPL.O_2">AAPL.O</span>), and Google parent Alphabet Inc (<span id="symbol_GOOGL.O_3">GOOGL.O</span>), but most companies, including Twitter, did not send their chief executive officers.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, called Twitter's announcement a "very positive development," but said more was needed. </p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>"Addressing the use of social media by terrorists will require a sustained and cooperative effort between the technology sector, the Intelligence Community, and law enforcement," he said.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Still, Twitter said in a blog post that it has cooperated with law enforcement when appropriate.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>It said that it tries to strike a balance between enforcing its rules on prohibited behaviors, the needs of law enforcement and the desire by users to share their views - including offensive ones.  </p><span id="midArticle_13"/><span id="midArticle_14"/><p> (Additional reporting by Arathy S Nair in Bengaluru and Dustin Volz in Washington,; Editing by Kirti Pandey, Stephen R.
