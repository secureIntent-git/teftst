He said he can recognize a fellow regular at the races because they are less likely to be fancily dressed.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="254" data-total-count="3787">For the first time in 20 years, Mr. Zuyus said he would not be able to attend the races on Belmont Stakes day. His wife is recovering from a surgery, and he did not want to leave her for 12 hours. And anyway, this year would bring no Triple Crown winner.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="115" data-total-count="3902">“There’s no excitement in the air,” he said, comparing this year to last. “The place is virtually empty.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="139" data-total-count="4041">But when Mr. Zuyus paused to watch the sixth race on a giant television and his chosen horse, Rock Eagle, won, he looked decidedly excited.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="65" data-total-count="4106">He raised his arms in the air. “Go on, baby!” Mr. Zuyus said.</p><div id="addenda" class="addenda" readability="9">

        <strong> Correction: June 11, 2016 </strong> <p>An earlier version of this article misstated the number of people estimated to attend the Belmont Stakes on Saturday.
