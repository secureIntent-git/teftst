Prosecutors had said the sentence was the maximum Couch could receive under terms set when his case was transferred to an adult court from the juvenile system. </p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Lawyers for Couch had argued it was excessive.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Attorneys for Couch and prosecutors could not comment on the judge's move due to a gag order he imposed in the case.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>At his trial in juvenile court in 2013, a psychologist testifying on his behalf said Couch was so spoiled by his wealthy parents that he could not tell right from wrong. The psychologist described the affliction as "affluenza," and the term quickly became a media buzzword.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Couch was found guilty of intoxication manslaughter and sentenced to 10 years of probation in the juvenile system, a penalty that sparked outrage from critics who ridiculed the affluenza defense and said his family's wealth had helped keep him out of jail.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Couch and his mother, Tonya Couch, were taken into custody by Mexican authorities in the Pacific Coast resort of Puerto Vallarta. They fled the United States after a video on social media appeared to show the teen at a party where alcohol was being consumed, which would have violated the drink- and drug-free terms of his juvenile probation.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><span id="midArticle_10"/><span id="midArticle_11"/><p> (Reporting by Jon Herskovitz in Austin, Texas, and Marice Richter in Fort Worth; Writing by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Leslie Adler)</p><span id="midArticle_12"/></div>
