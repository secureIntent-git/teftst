                <p>Tom Angel, Los Angeles County Sheriff Jim McDonnell's chief of staff, has resigned after <a href="http://www.scpr.org/news/2016/04/27/60066/la-sheriff-official-forwarded-offensive-emails/">admitting to sending offensive emails </a>mocking minorities, women and Muslims when he worked for the Burbank police.</p>

<p>McDonnell announced Angel's resignation is a message posted to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LosAngelesCountySheriffsDepartment/photos/a.227394993954088.77910.225060950854159/1351951678165075/?type=3&amp;theater">department's Facebook page</a> Sunday afternoon. McDonnell called Angel's emails, revealed last month by the Los Angeles Times through a public records request, "deeply troubling."</p>

<p>"Despite the Sheriff’s Department’s many recent efforts to fortify public trust and enhance internal and external accountability and transparency, this incident reminds us that we and other law enforcement agencies still have work to do," McDonnell wrote. "I intend to turn this situation into a learning opportunity for all LASD personnel."</p>

<p>Angel sent the emails in 2012 and 2013 while working as the assistant chief for the Burbank Police Department. He told the Times earlier this week that he was sorry he sent the emails and never intended them to become public.</p>

<p>McDonnell said that he will institute random audits of department email accounts and will "examine our current training framework."</p>
