Checkpoints at city entrances were closed, even as the protests remained largely nonviolent.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="290" data-total-count="763">The scenes of protest, circulated in social media photos and videos, were potent demonstrations of the anger that had grown during months of protests by Iraqis who have demanded that Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi carry out measures to end sectarian quotas in politics and fight corruption.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="221" data-total-count="984">One protester, speaking to the Kurdish news channel Rudaw, pointed to chocolates on the desks of lawmakers and said: “People have nothing to eat. The lawmakers are sitting here eating chocolates and mocking our pain.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="212" data-total-count="1196">The American Embassy in Baghdad reported on Twitter Saturday that rumors of Iraqi officials seeking safety in the embassy compound were not true, nor were reports that the embassy itself was evacuating personnel.</p><div id="story-ad-1" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="141" data-total-count="1337" id="story-continues-1">For many protesters, jubilant at having breached the blast walls and razor wire that ring the Green Zone, it was a place they had never been.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="326" data-total-count="1663">To Iraqis who have lived through the reign of Saddam Hussein, the American occupation and the current turmoil, the Green Zone has long symbolized tyranny, occupation and corruption. Above all, it has been a sign of the separation between ordinary people and a ruling elite unresponsive to the aspirations of <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/iraq/index.html?inline=nyt-geo" title="More news and information about Iraq." class="meta-loc">Iraq</a>’s citizens.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="280" data-total-count="1943">The mere presence of protesters in the halls of government on Saturday deepened a political crisis that has paralyzed Iraq’s government as it struggles to keep up the fight against the Islamic State and faces a collapse in oil prices that has sharply reduced government revenue.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="400" data-total-count="2343">The protesters were mostly supporters of the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, who has rallied his followers to push for demands and has largely supported Mr. Abadi’s promises, still unfulfilled, to improve how the government works. The ease with which they penetrated the rim of the Green Zone suggested that security forces were supportive of the protesters, as there were no reports of shots fired.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="321" data-total-count="2664">The Parliament was stormed after a session that had been scheduled for Saturday was postponed because a quorum could not be reached. Mr. Abadi had been expected to introduce several new ministers as part of a promise to overhaul his cabinet and fill it with technocrats instead of politicians beholden to a party or sect.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="207" data-total-count="2871">On Tuesday, Mr. Abadi gained approval for some of the new ministers, but only after a revolt from opposition lawmakers who had called for his ouster, even tossing water bottles at him as he entered the room.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="128" data-total-count="2999">It was unclear on Saturday afternoon how Mr. Abadi would respond, and how he would regain control over the country’s politics.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="356" data-total-count="3355">Mr. Abadi, a Shiite, rose to the office of prime minister in 2014, just after the Islamic State seized control of Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city. He replaced Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, another Shiite, whose sectarian policies were blamed by the United States and others for marginalizing Iraq’s minority Sunnis and allowing the rise of the Islamic State.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="203" data-total-count="3558">Earlier on Saturday, at least 21 people were killed and 42 were wounded when a bomb exploded in a Baghdad market, according to the police and hospital officials. The Islamic State claimed responsibility.</p><a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#whats-next">Continue reading the main story</a>
