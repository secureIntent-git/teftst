<br><div id="start-of-content"><article class="content link-underline relative body-copy" data-js="content" itemprop="articleBody" readability="47.269565217391"><p>Very rarely is your trusty WIRED Culture crew all watching the same thing at the same time (unless we’re at the movies together). Usually one of us is watching Netflix, while another is in a VR headset, and the other is mindfully staring at a laptop. But on Sunday, nearly all of us were glued to the TV. Why? The new <em>Suicide Squad</em> trailer. </p>



<p>The clip, which premiered during the MTV Movie Awards, is a rollicking good time, and frankly, this week the <em>Monitor</em> Skwad can’t shut up about it. The music. The mayhem. The Margot (Robbie). There’s just a lot of greatness happening here. And elsewhere during the Movie Awards telecast there were new trailers and clips for <em>Captain America: Civil War</em> and <em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em>. We’re talking about those, too. </p>
<p>But there’s more than just trailer talk in this week’s podcast. We’ve also got some chit-chat about the return of <em>Outlander</em> and a short but sweet list of our current favorite things. So sit back and enjoy—the <em>Monitor</em> podcast is here for you. </p>
<p>A few helpful links for things we talk about in the podcast:</p>
