		<p>ANAHEIM, Calif. -- You're going to be told that it wasn't any one thing that snuffed out the Oregon basketball season on Saturday. You're going to be assured that no single player, that no individual feat, that no one element could send one team to a Final Four and the other into a basketball coma.</p>
<p>First, though, can I say something?</p>
<p>Buddy... <em>yield?</em></p>
<p>Oklahoma beat Oregon 80-68 in an Elite Eight game that was never really in doubt. Buddy Hield shot the Ducks out of the NCAA Tournament, scoring 37 points while playing a game of "H-O-R-S-E" that nobody at the Honda Center will soon forget. The Sooners cut down the nets, but not before Hield first wore them out.</p>
<p>As Hield stood on the ladder and chopped down his part of the threads, the Sooners' fans chanted, "<em>Bud-deee!! Bud-deee!!</em>" This was interrupted by a scissor snip, and then a Southern California NBA fan who shouted, "You're going to the Lakers!</p>
<p>Maybe. But first Hield is going to Houston, where he might just win it all.</p>
<p>The Ducks retreated to the locker room. Not far behind them was Pac 12 Commissioner Larry Scott, who watched the game courtside alongside Oregon athletic director Rob Mullens. As much as I want to believe that no single thing ended Oregon's season -- one thing very much feels as though it did.</p>
<p>The Ducks had never seen anything like Oklahoma. They weren't battle tested. They weren't resilient. From the tip, Oregon looked like a team that didn't know what to do with a talented, strong, mature, well-organized group like the Sooners.</p>
<p>"They just killed us on the boards," coach Dana Altman said. "They were much quicker to the ball, much more active."</p>
<p>Muhammed Ali had Sonny Liston and Joe Frazier. The Golden State Warriors have the Spurs and Cavaliers. Peyton Manning had Tom Brady. Oklahoma had Kansas and Iowa State in its conference. But the Ducks? They're stuck with a bunch of foot-shuffling rubes and that didn't help a bit.</p>
<p>Proverbs tells us, <em>"As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another."</em> I couldn't help but look at the challenge that was unfolding in front of Oregon on Saturday and wonder if the bewildered look on the Ducks bench couldn't have been helped by better tests in conference play.</p>
<p>Before this NCAA Tournament, the Big 12 hadn't won a single Sweet 16 game in three straight years. It had become a running joke. Seven teams in the Big Dance every season, great RPI, lots of hype, but no results. No Final Four teams, not even an Elite Eight team, between 2012-15. In that period the conference went 0-5 in Sweet 16 games. And while the rest of us think that losing NCAA Tournament games is simply about losing face, really, it's about losing momentum and money.</p>
<p>About $2 million per victory, in fact.</p>
<p>Oregon is out of the tournament, but the Ducks run earned the conference approximately $6 million in revenue (paid in installments over the next six years). Colorado, Arizona, USC, Cal and Oregon State all lost first-round games as the higher-seeded team. Basically, the conference members lost games the selection committee favored them to win. Utah won one NCAA game, so the Pac-12 Conference leaves the NCAA Tournament with approximately $8 million to split among 12 members over the next six years.</p>
<p>Basically, a cool $100,000 each, minus expenses.</p>
<p>Not enough.</p>
<p>The apologists wants to dismiss this disappointment as a case of a great conference having a poor postseason. But that's simplistic and short-sighted thinking. The basic infrastructure and resources of the conference are called into question.Â <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/sports/oregonian/john_canzano/index.ssf/2016/03/canzano_pac-12_television_deal.html">The Pac 12 Networks cumbersome distribution issue plays a role here.</a> It not only hurts fans, but inhibits regional and national recruiting. The lag in revenue generated by the conference television deal crushes the bottom line for some. Competition is cyclical, sure, but the Pac 12 looks like basketball Silly Putty right now. And putty doesn't sharpen iron.</p>
A stunned Altman reeled off the Ducks accomplishments: "We won 31 ballgames, we won the league. We won the conference title. This is the Elite Eight, so we did some good things."
<p>Oregon did its part. The Ducks duty now is to keep this team together while the conference catches up. On their way out, I hope Brooks, Casey Benson, Tyler Dorsey and Chris Boucher looked over at the Sooners, whose four-man nucleus started its 104th straight game on Saturday, and saw their own future. I hope Oregon prep sensation Payton Pritchard is in that UO future too.</p>
<p>Hield turned down a second-round draft spot in the NBA Draft last season to come back to Oklahoma. He played like a top-five pick on Saturday. So yeah, Oregon needs to foster that continuity. But this is mostly on the 11 other Pac 12 conference members, who need to join the Ducks in rattling around this college basketball tournament in a more meaningful way.</p>
<p>The Ducks conference tournament 31-point blowout win over Utah was swell, but it suggested the Pac 12 was in over its head nationally, didn't it? Unlike football, one program can not carry the rest of the conference by making the playoff. The conference must move as a herd. Oregon was left out in the open, alone, for too long.</p>
<p>Maybe you saw the end for Oregon coming on Friday after forward Dillon Brooks said of Hield, "I hope he does guard me so I can take it to him." In the first half, Hield hit five three pointers and Brooks looked like one of those bull riders at the rodeo who gets his hand stuck in the ropes and can't let go.</p>
<p>But again, it wasn't any one thing Oklahoma did that cost Oregon. It wasn't Hield alone doing the dismantling. Teammates Jordan Woodard scored nine straight Sooners points during one first-half stretch, and Isaiah Cousins scored eight straight in another run. Oklahoma spread Oregon's defense out like a turkey, then started carving it up.</p>
<p>It wasn't one thing that made this Elite Eight stage feel too big for the Oregon Ducks. Out-rebounded. Out-defended. Out-toughed. It wasn't coaching. It wasn't fatigue. Not even Hield's shooting did Oregon in.</p>
<p>Rather, the lack of competition in conference finally bit the Ducks. Because if there was a single factor that crushed Oregon on Saturday it was that the Ducks looked like a team that had never seen great guards, never played against a complete team, and didn't know what to do when faced with a challenge of this magnitude.</p>
<p>After, UO senior Elgin Cook sifted through his thoughts.</p>
<p>"My season is over. We're done. No one expected it. We were confident. We believed in each other..."</p>
<p>You did fine, kid. It's the Pac 12 that must do better.</p>
