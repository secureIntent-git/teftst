                <p>Todd Palin, the husband of Sarah Palin, has been hospitalized after a serious snow machine accident Sunday night, as the former Alaska governor cancelled a planned campaign appearance on behalf of Donald Trump to return to Alaska.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>The Trump campaign confirmed Monday afternoon that Todd Palin was in a “bad snow machine accident” and currently is hospitalized.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>“Governor Palin is returning to Alaska to be with her husband and looks forward to being back on the campaign trail soon. Mr. Trump’s thoughts and prayers are with the Palin family at this time,” the campaign said.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>The statement came shortly after the campaign abruptly announced that the Sarah Palin appearance originally scheduled for noon at The Villages in Florida had been cancelled.  </p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>Just two days earlier, the former Alaska governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee had posted on Facebook that she was heading out to the Sunshine State to stump for Trump, ahead of the state’s Tuesday primary.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>“Surrendering my ice fishing hole on our still-frozen solid lake to other anglers for the next few days, I'm humbled to be able to hit the campaign trail again for our next POTUS, Donald J. Trump,” she wrote. </p>                
                

            	 
	                
                
            
                <p>The details on her husband’s accident are unclear. NBC News reported that he is in intensive care, describing the accident as “very serious.”</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>Nick-named during Palin’s term as governor as the state’s “first dude,” Todd Palin is also an avid snow machine competitor. He has won the grueling Iron Dog snow machine competition several times.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>Sarah Palin, meanwhile, has become one of Trump’s most vocal supporters since endorsing him in January. Before cancelling Monday’s event, she appeared on Trump's behalf at the Arcadia All-Florida Championship Rodeo and Florida Strawberry Festival on Sunday.</p>
