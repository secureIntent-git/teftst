        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The first group of returnees from Greece were brought from Lesbos and Chios to the Turkey's Aegean coastal town of Dikili on Monday. They were then taken in buses escorted by gendarmes to a "reception and removal" center in a fenced compound in the town of Kirklareli near the Bulgarian border, from where most are expected to be sent back to their home countries.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>"We will take in people through Dikili again tomorrow. We will take in around 200 irregular migrants," the Turkish government official said, declining to be identified because the plans have not yet been made public.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>MIGRANTS DEMAND FREEDOM</p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Monday's group included 130 Pakistanis, 42 Afghans, as well as nationals of Iran, Congo, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, India, Iraq, Ivory Coast and Somalia, people familiar with an internal European Commission report said.

        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>The United Nations refugee agency UNHCR has stopped transporting arrivals to and from the Moria camp on Lesbos, initially set up to register arrivals but which has since become what it calls a "detention center".</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>Through barbed wire at the camp, one man held up a piece of cardboard, which read: "Kill us if you want."</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>On the wall of the sprawling gated complex, which was once an army camp, graffiti read: 'No one is illegal'.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>UNHCR says there are some 600 people above capacity at Moria, including pregnant women, lactating mothers and children, with insufficient food. Other aid groups have also pulled out from the site in protest at conditions there.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><span id="midArticle_3"/><span id="midArticle_4"/><p> (Additional reporting by Dasha Afanasieva in Izmir, Turkey; Writing by Nick Tattersall; Editing by Richard Balmforth)</p><span id="midArticle_5"/></div>
