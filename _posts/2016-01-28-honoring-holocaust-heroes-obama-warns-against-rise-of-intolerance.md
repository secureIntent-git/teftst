<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocation">WASHINGTON</span> President Barack Obama warned on Wednesday against the rise of religious intolerance in veiled criticism of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump during an event to honor men and women who helped save Jews from peril in the Holocaust.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Obama made the remarks at the Israeli Embassy, where he attended a ceremony to honor, posthumously, two Americans and two Polish people who protected Jews from the Nazis during World War Two. The event came on International Holocaust Remembrance Day.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>His remarks, the first of a sitting U.S. president at Israel's embassy, were also a sign of lowering tensions between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's administration. The event was hosted by Israeli Ambassador Ron Dermer, who helped orchestrate Netanyahu's speech last year to Congress about the then-pending Iran nuclear deal. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The speech irked the White House. Dermer, at the ceremony on Wednesday, thanked Obama for the message of friendship he conveyed by attending.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The president is also clearly irked by Trump's rhetoric. The billionaire businessman, the front-runner in the race for the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election, has called for the United States to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the country as a national security measure.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>"An attack on any faith is an attack on all of our faiths," Obama said.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>"For Americans, in particular, we should understand that it’s an attack on our diversity, on the very idea that people of different backgrounds can live together and thrive together."</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Obama added: "Here, tonight, we must confront the reality that around the world, anti-Semitism is on the rise.  We cannot deny it."</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>"Too often, especially in times of change, especially in times of anxiety and uncertainty, we are too willing to give into a base desire to find someone else - someone different - to blame for our struggles," he said.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Before Obama spoke, "Righteous Among the Nations" awards were presented to the families of Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds, teacher Lois Gunden, and a Polish couple, Walery and Maryla Zbijewski, for risking their lives to save Jews from the Holocaust.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>The awards were given by Yad Vashem, an organization to commemorate the Holocaust, on behalf of Israel and the Jewish people. </p><span id="midArticle_11"/><span id="midArticle_12"/><p> (Reporting by Jeff Mason; Editing by <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=peter.cooney&amp;">Peter Cooney</a>)</p><span id="midArticle_13"/></div>
