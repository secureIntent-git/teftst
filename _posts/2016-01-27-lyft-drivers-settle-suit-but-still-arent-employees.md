<br><div id=""><p>Lyft has agreed to pay more than $12 million in a proposed class-action lawsuit seeking to classify drivers as employees in California. In a settlement agreement reached late Tuesday, the ride-hailing service would extend additional benefits to drivers and reimburse them for some expenses but not make them official employees.</p>
<p>Shannon Liss-Riordan, the Boston attorney who represented Lyft drivers in the case and negotiated the settlement, said the agreement also includes critical changes to how Lyft will conduct its business, leading to better benefits for workers.</p>
<p>“We believe this is a fair settlement and adequate resolution of the claims we brought, given the risks we faced in the litigation against Lyft,” Liss-Riordan said.</p>

</p>

<p>Previously, Lyft’s terms of service stated that the company could deactivate a driver for any reason; now, the ride-hailing company will only be able to do so for one of a list of predetermined reasons, such as a low passenger rating, according to Liss-Riordan. Drivers at risk of deactivation, meanwhile, will be given clear notice and an opportunity to present their side. If a driver is deactivated but would like to contest the decision, he or she he can challenge the ruling in arbitration, at Lyft’s expense. Drivers will also be able to address pay-related issues in arbitration.</p>
<p>The settlement also includes a provision for a “favorite driver” feature, where Lyft drivers who are identified as favorites by their passengers “will receive added benefits,” according to Liss-Riordan.</p>



<p>“We are pleased to have resolved this matter on terms that preserve the flexibility of drivers to control when, where and for how long they drive on the platform and enable consumers to continue benefitting from safe, affordable transportation,” Kristin Sverchek, general counsel at Lyft, said in a <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-lyft-drivers-settlement-idUSKCN0V50FR?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technologyNews">statement to Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>“Apart from this settlement, we continue to explore a variety of ways to provide services and support for our driver community, including the potential for portable benefits, because we believe it is important to preserve the flexibility drivers cherish while also strengthening their safety net.”</p>
<p>The $12.25 million in damages will be paid out in proportion to the amount drivers have driven for Lyft in California, Liss-Riordan says. Based on the data Liss-Riordan’s team has reviewed, the majority of the more than 100,000 drivers who have driven for Lyft have logged less than a total of 50 hours with Lyft.</p>
<p>Liss-Riordan noted that Lyft successfully enforced an arbitration clause in its driver contracts that contains a ban on class actions, which contributed to the decision to seek a settlement rather than pursue the suit further. A federal judge must still approve the settlement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Uber, the world’s biggest ride-hailing service, has not been able to enforce a similar clause and will go to trial on June 20 to fight <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/12/uber-class-action-suit-expands/">a similar class-action suit brought by California drivers</a>, also represented by Liss-Riordan, seeking to be recognized as employees of the company.</p>
