                    <p> Angie Wisner, a mental health technician and mother of three, went to Thursday's protest in Dallas because she wanted to "come away with something for my kids." </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Instead, she walked away with someone else's kid. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> In the haze and fury of <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/dallas-police-ambush/dallas-suspect-was-upset-about-recent-police-shootings-wanted-kill-n605916">the ambush that left 12 Dallas law enforcement officers shot</a>, five fatally, Wisner, 33, was approached by a boy. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> "We kind of ran into each other," Wisner, 33, told NBC News. "We were running and he came up to me and said, 'Ma'am can I come with you because I lost my mama.' He was shaking, out of breath, he was scared. And I said of course." </p>

                    <p> The boy, JaJuan, was at the rally with his mother, Shetamia Taylor, and her three other sons. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> When the shots first rang out, Taylor got separated from all but one of her children, her 15-year-old, and threw herself on top of him to protect the teen, Taylor's sister said. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> "It was a panic," Taylor's sister, Theresa Williams, told MSNBC Friday. Taylor was shot in the leg and was still hospitalized Friday night. Taylor saw her oldest son grab the youngest child and make it to a garage, Williams said. </p>
                
              
                    
              
              
                    <p> But JaJuan was missing. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Wisner and JaJuan clung to each other for about 30 minutes trying to evade death and injury by running all over the downtown area, attempting to find shelter. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> "We started running back towards my truck, it was by where the shooting started," she said. "Police officers kept turning us around because they were still shooting, so we kept running." </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Finally another stranger allowed them to take cover in an apartment. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> "We did not know his mama was shot ... He kept calling but she wasn't answering," she said. "The cousin finally came and got him after about an hour and a half." </p>
                
              
                    
              
              
                    <p> Wisner, who does not know Taylor, said she was heartbroken to learn JaJuan's mother had been wounded. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> "I just helped that baby and it really hurt my heart when I heard about it." </p>

                    <p> Wisner is still happy that she went to the protest, which for her, was not an expression of the hate that ruined so many lives Thursday. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> "I'm really thankful," she said matter-of-factly. "Because the protest was not about that... It's not about black and white, it was about everybody having the right to free speech and a right to live without being killed. Even cops." </p>
