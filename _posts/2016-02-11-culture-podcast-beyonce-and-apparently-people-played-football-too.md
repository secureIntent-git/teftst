<br><div id="start-of-content"><article class="content link-underline relative body-copy" data-js="content" itemprop="articleBody" readability="52.961636828645"><p>Hey, have you see that video up there? The one with Beyoncé? Of course you have. It’s literally all anyone has been able to talk about since it dropped on Saturday. (Well, some people were talking about the presidential race, but still.) We are all, metaphorically speaking, in “Formation” now. </p>



<p>Nowhere is that more true than on this week’s <em>Monitor</em> podcast. Yes, friends, we too have many wonderful thoughts on Beyoncé’s new song and video. We also have all kinds of opinions about the Super Bowl, where never-not-ubiquitous Queen Bey also performed, and the myriad (mostly terrible) commercials that came with it. </p>
<p>We have other stuff in the mix, too. Like <em>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</em> and our now-almost-weekly check-in on <em>American Crime Story: The People vs. O.J. Simpson</em>. It’s time to tune in. Editors and contributors <a href="http://www.wired.com/author/peterrubin/" target="_blank">Peter Rubin</a>, <a href="http://www.wired.com/author/awatercutter/" target="_blank">Angela Watercutter</a>, and <a href="http://www.wired.com/author/kevin-mcfarland/" target="_blank">K.M. McFarland</a> are in the booth and we promise there are no Red Lobster jokes or puns in this podcast. Probably.</p>
