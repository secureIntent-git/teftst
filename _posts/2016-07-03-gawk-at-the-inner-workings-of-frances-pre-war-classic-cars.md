<br><div id="start-of-content"><p>Open the hood of a modern car and you see …. lots of plastic. It’s sad. To keep people from meddling with anything beyond filling wiper fluid, automakers shield the engine with a cover. Accessing the engine is harder than getting into the Pope’s bedroom.</p>
<p>That makes the Mullin Automotive Museum’s annual “Under the Hood” event a bit like snagging a full access pass to the Vatican: You can see everything. This year, the Los Angeles classic car collection invited people to gawk at the inner workings of its collection of pre-war French vehicles, filled with brass, dust-covered fans, and carburetors. </p>
<p>These cars, from the likes of Bugatti, Renault, and Delahaye, exude class and elegance. And they look great from the outside, too.</p>
