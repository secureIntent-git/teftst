<br><div id="start-of-content"><article class="content link-underline relative body-copy" data-js="content" itemprop="articleBody" readability="54.190748143918"><p>Garry Shandling—who <a href="http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/garry-shandling-dead-larry-sanders-show-show-1201738601/" target="_blank">died today </a> at the age of 66—was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_f4MnOAoy8" target="_blank">stand-up</a>, a TV writer, and an occasional <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGcTX1uDWAw">big-screen scene-stealer</a>. But he’ll probably be best remembered as the star and creator of <em>The Larry Sanders Show</em>, the mid-‘90s cable comedy that began as a lampoon of the late-night talk-show wars, but evolved into something deeper and nervier: An unflinching, doggedly hilarious look at the narcissism, anxiety, and selfishness that are all but second nature to the people who entertain us. But Shandling, who played Sandlers as a lovable weasel, never made the show a bum trip. A veteran of Hollywood since his early twenties, when he worked on such hits as <em>Sanford &amp; Son</em>, Shandling clearly loved showbiz, what with its weirdo occupants, deftly managed ego battles, and raw reservoirs of talent. <em>Sanders </em>was, in its dark-humored own way, an affectionate ode to an industry whose rampant craziness and short-lived joys Shandling had witnessed first-hand.</p>
<p>And though Shandling was almost always praised for the writing on <em>Larry Sanders</em>—and deservedly so—he was also a crackerjack performer, an actor never more in his element than when Larry was stuck in an awkward moment. There are dozens of primo <em>Sanders </em>clips to rewatch at a moment like this, but my favorite might be this encounter between Larry and David Duchovny, who stars as himself, and who may or may not be harboring a crush on the talk-show host. Sanders’ discomfort is all over Shandling’s face, as he stiffens his smile and darts his eyes, pausing to collect his wits (Shandling was one of comedy’s all-time greatest pausers). Watch the clip. And it almost goes without saying, but: No flipping.</p>
