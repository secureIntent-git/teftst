        <p><strong>BAILEY, Colo.</strong>- A Colorado deputy was killed in a shootout Wednesday morning and two other deputies were injured, <a href="http://denver.cbslocal.com/2016/02/24/deputy-shot-and-killed-2-others-wounded/">reports CBS Denver</a>.</p><p>The Park County Sheriff's Office deputies were shot at about 9:30 a.m., while attempting to serve an eviction notice, according to officials. The subject of that eviction fired on the deputies and in the ensuing firefight, a deputy and the suspect were killed. Two other deputies were hit, one of whom suffered life-threatening injuries requiring emergency surgery.</p><p>The gunman has been identified by police as 58-year-old Martin Wirth.</p><p><figure class="image pull-none image-large " readability="1"><span class="img "><img src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Colorado-deputy-suspect-killed-in-shootout-2-others-wounded-CBS-News.jpg" alt="martin-wirth.jpg" height="350" width="620" srcset="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Colorado-deputy-suspect-killed-in-shootout-2-others-wounded-CBS-News.jpg 1x, http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/02/25/7a7a08c9-5f80-4901-a0f2-9b05f4dbd9f9/thumbnail/1240x700/b88d32fbbe29dfedd53394fa104d2206/martin-wirth.jpg 2x"/></span><figcaption readability="2"><p>58-year-old Martin Wirth.</p><p>

The well-maintained houses sit on big lots, with room for horses to graze in an area popular with hunters and anglers.</p><p>Wirth appeared on the deck of his home when the officers arrived, then went back inside, according to the Park County sheriff's office account of the shooting.</p><p>Officers followed him in, and Wirth fired on them, prompting them to return fire, sheriff's officials said.</p><p>The shooting killed Corporal Nate Carrigan, a 13-year veteran of the sheriff's office. One of the wounded officers underwent surgery for life-threatening injuries and was in critical condition.</p><p><figure class="image pull-none image-large "><span class="img "><img src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1456372811_454_Colorado-deputy-suspect-killed-in-shootout-2-others-wounded-CBS-News.jpg" alt="officer.jpg" height="350" width="620" srcset="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1456372811_454_Colorado-deputy-suspect-killed-in-shootout-2-others-wounded-CBS-News.jpg 1x, http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/02/25/d376023f-7a82-4d46-a211-d008321f9315/thumbnail/1240x700/3f28910f11b02e7a415fbb28920c61e4/officer.jpg 2x"/></span><figcaption><p>Nate Carrigan.</p><p>

John Hickenlooper, the state attorney general and a judge in 2013. The federal lawsuit claimed that state foreclosure laws were unconstitutional and that Wirth and his unnamed guests were "in imminent danger of being wrongfully deprived of home and property while also being threatened with an armed and forcible entry onto the property and into the home."</p><p>He asked a federal judge to block Park County from selling his home, evicting him or forcibly entering the house and to strike down several state laws. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit last September.</p><p>A website by a group called the Colorado Foreclosure Resistance Coalition includes undated posts that called for supporters to join Wirth in "non-violent eviction resistance." The website includes a video of a man identified as Wirth railing against mortgage companies as criminals.</p><p>A call to the group, whose website says it is part of the Occupy movement, was not immediately returned.</p><p>Tim Holland, who was involved in the Occupy Denver movement with Wirth, struggled to reconcile the shooting with his memories of Wirth as a "sweet, quirky, kindhearted guy."</p><p>"It seems to me that he was just pushed to the end of his rope, and he tried every single approach to addressing his grievances, and at the end, he chose to not let them take his house away from him," Holland said. "It's the middle of winter in the mountains. Where was he going to go?"</p><p>Wirth ran for the state Senate in 2014 as a Green Party candidate, but he lost to an incumbent Republican. In a questionnaire to candidates by The Denver Post, Wirth wrote of corruption in the political system, his support for Colorado's marijuana laws and the plight of the poor.</p><p>When asked whether he supported the death penalty, Wirth wrote, "Killing people to show that killing people is wrong is a piece of idiotic hypocrisy."</p><p>He wrote disparagingly of police, the federal government and corporations on his candidate page on Facebook and praised former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who leaked millions of documents about government surveillance. He made regular posts criticizing leading presidential candidates from both parties.</p><p>Neighbor Terry Rogers, a counselor and pastor at Platte Canyon Community Church, said he did not know Wirth well and believes no one in the area did.</p><p>"He was pretty reclusive," said Rogers, who could see law enforcement vehicles responding to the shooting across a snow-covered pasture from his driveway.</p><p>The area of rocky, pine-covered hills is about 45 miles southwest of Denver where several camps host Girl Scouts and other youth during the summer. The neighborhood is several miles outside Bailey, a hamlet of just a few restaurants and shops.</p><p>There, a gunman took several girls hostage in a high school classroom a decade ago, killing one before himself.</p><p>Sam Lung, who lives nearby, said he often hears gunshots in the area, which has a target practice site.</p><p>He said people often shoot in their backyards, "practicing their Second Amendment rights." He said he did not hear the gunshots Wednesday.</p><p>"It is a dark day," Medina said.</p><p>The identities of the suspect and deputies have not yet been releases, but officials said the deputy who died was a 12-year veteran with the sheriff's office.</p>
