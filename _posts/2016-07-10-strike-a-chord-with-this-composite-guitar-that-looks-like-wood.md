Add this hi-fi gear to your workstation set-up and experience audio bliss all day long.</p>
<p class="no-marg"><strong>Bowers &amp; Wilkins P7 Headphones | <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F6PRSMW/?tag=w050b-20">$400</a></strong></p>
<p>This decadently appointed headset hails from the UK, where Bowers &amp; Wilkins has been gilding the eardrums of posh audiophiles for 50 years. The leather cups form a seal around your ears, stifling ambient noise and keeping your Radiohead private. Rich-sounding 40-mm drivers put you right in the studio with Thom and Co.</p>
<p class="no-marg"><strong>Master &amp; Dynamic Headphone Stand | <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NGX46NK/?tag=w050b-20">$59</a></strong></p>
<p>Don’t just plunk all this fine gear on your desk in an unaesthetic heap. Arrange your components with care, and perch your headphones on a proper stand. The heavy steel construction on this one stabilizes your cans, and a rubber foot keeps that Knoll desk scratch-free.</p>
<p class="no-marg"><strong>Woo Audio WA7 Fireflies | <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EJNQ5T4/?tag=w050b-20">$999</a></strong></p>
<p>A dedicated headphone amp sweetens up your audio, adding drama and volume. This compact rig collects digital audio via USB, converts it to analog, then pumps it through a pair of vacuum tubes. You could melt what remains of Greenland with this much warmth. Plus, that protective glass block looks like the damn business.</p>
<p class="no-marg"><strong>EK Japan 22 Hybrid Tube Amplifier | <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UB6VQ8S/?tag=w050b-20">$699</a></strong></p>
<p>Dreamed up by designer Koichi Futatsumata, this svelte amp oozes modernist cool as effortlessly as it dispenses sizzling audio waves. It puts out 12 watts per channel—plenty of juice to power most small desktop or bookshelf speakers. Use the Woo Audio unit to glisten up your digital tracks, then pour the signal through this.</p>
<p class="no-marg"><strong>Well Rounded Sound MM | <a href="http://wellroundedsound.com/products/copy-of-yorkie-1">$249</a></strong></p>
<p>Feeling a little fuzzy after a long day of ideating? Blow out the mental cobwebs by cranking up these wool-felt-covered sound boxes. The 2.5-inch full-range drivers are impressively lively, and the minimalist stands slide fore and aft for different firing angles. They’re perfect for when booze-toting coworkers swing by at 5:30 expecting to be entertained.</p>
