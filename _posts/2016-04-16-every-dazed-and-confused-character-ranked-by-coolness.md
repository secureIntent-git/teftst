 [ad_1]
<br><div readability="19">
				<p>We know, we know: Some of you are livid, just L-I-V-I-D, that this dude isn't at the top of this list. But even though Wooderson is, in many ways, the very embodiment of coolness—the duds, the wheels, the one-liners—he's also kind of a sad, skeevy horndog who's afraid to grow up. The other <em>Dazed </em>denizens will get older; Wooderson will always stay the same age. It doesn't entirely diminish his coolness, but it does knock him down a few spots.</p>
