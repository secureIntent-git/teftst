                    <p> There's a new member of the Clinton family â€” just in time for Father's Day. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Chelsea Clinton, daughter of presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton, announced Saturday she had given birth to a boy named Aidan Clinton Mezvinsky. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> "Marc and I are overwhelmed with gratitude and love as we celebrate the birth of our son, Aidan Clinton Mezvinsky," Chelsea, 36, tweeted Saturday morning. </p>
                
              
              
              
                
              
              
              
                
                    
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
              
                    
              
              
                    <p> Aidan is the second child for Chelsea and Marc Mezvinsky, an investment banker. Their first, a daughter named Charlotte Clinton Mezvinsky, was born on Sept. 27, 2014. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Hillary Clinton had no public events Thursday or Friday, and has none on the calendar for this weekend, either. Her daughter stopped traveling far distances for the campaign about a month ago, but was still appearing at fundraisers in New Jersey before the primary on June 7. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Hillary Clinton frequently mentions her granddaughter Charlotte at campaign stops, often saying, "FaceTime was invented for grandparents." </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> At an event in Santa Barbara, California, earlier this month, she said becoming a grandparent is "truly like falling in love all over again, nothing like it." </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Hillary and Bill Clinton said in a statement Saturday that they were "overjoyed to be grandparents again." </p>
                
              
                    
              
              
                    <p> "We are all over the moon as Chelsea and Marc welcome Charlotte's little brother to the world and grateful for our many blessings. Chelsea and Aidan are both doing well and enjoying this very special time together," they said. </p>
