                    <p> Nevada Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval said Thursday that he is not interested in being tapped to fill the current vacancy on the Supreme Court. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Sandoval, a Republican who favors abortion rights and supported the court's decision on same sex marriage last year, made the statement just one day after news broke that he was being considered for the job. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> "Earlier today, I notified the White House that I do not wish to be considered at this time for possible nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States," Sandoval said in a statement, adding that he has also discussed his decision with top Senate leaders. "The notion of being considered for a seat on the highest court in the land is beyond humbling and I am incredibly grateful to have been mentioned." </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> The Washington Post first reported that Sandoval was being discussed as a potential pick. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Republicans in the Senate have said they will not consider any court pick by Obama, arguing that the next president should instead make the choice to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died earlier this month. GOP leaders said this week that even the choice of a Republican like Sandoval to fill the slot would not change that calculation. </p>
                
              
                    
              
              
                    <p> Democrats had also reacted with skepticism after reports floating the centrist Republican's name for the job. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Earlier Thursday, Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton threw cold water on the idea of Sandoval serving on the high court, saying she favors a "true progressive" for the post. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> "I sure hope the president chooses a true progressive who will stand up for the values and the interests of the people of this country, who understand that you need to protect the right to vote of a person, not the right of a corporation to buy an election," she said. </p>
