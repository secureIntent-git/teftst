        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Two-thirds of the projected losses are expected to fall in the office and administrative sectors as smart machines take over more routine tasks, according to latest findings, which are based on a global survey of personnel and strategy executives.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>The WEF has made "the fourth industrial revolution" - a topic covering robotics, nanotechnology, 3D printing and biotechnology - the official theme of this year's Davos meeting, which runs from Jan. 20 to 23.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
