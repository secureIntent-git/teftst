Major League Baseball, the organization that runs professional baseball in North America, said in November it would choose the Rays as the team to play in Havana if it could make a deal with the Cuban Baseball Federation.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>"During a time of historic change, we appreciate the constructive role afforded by our shared passion for the game, and we look forward to experiencing Cuba's storied baseball tradition and the passion of its many loyal fans," MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Obama will attend the game, a senior White House adviser said in a tweet late on Tuesday.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"Charting new #CubaPolicy means stronger ties between Cubans &amp; Americans - we all share a love of baseball,” tweeted Ben Rhodes, Obama’s deputy national security adviser.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The game will be played at the 45,000-seat Latin American Stadium, site of a 1999 exhibition between the Baltimore Orioles and Cuba's national team. It has been undergoing improvements, including installation of a new infield, under MLB supervision.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>The game takes place 15 months after a thawing of relations between the former Cold War enemies. Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro agreed to normalize relations in December 2014 and the two sides restored diplomatic ties and reopened embassies in Havana and Washington last year.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Obama's visit on March 21 and 22 will mark the first by a sitting U.S. president since 1928 and the first since Fidel Castro's rebels overthrew a pro-American government in 1959.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Earlier on Tuesday, the Rolling Stones said they would perform a free outdoor concert in Havana on March 25, a milestone in a country where the Communist government once banned the group's music as an "ideological deviation".</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>PLAYER DEFECTIONS</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>The exhibition game also comes during an effort in both countries to halt the defection of Cuba's best players.

        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>In the latest blow, two brothers from Cuba's pre-eminent baseball family, Yulieski and Lourdes Gurriel, abandoned a Cuban team traveling in the Dominican Republic in February.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Major League Baseball and the Cuban Baseball Federation lack an agreement on player transfers because of the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba. As a consequence, Cuban players with big-league aspirations have defected.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>MLB has applied for special permission from the U.S. government to allow teams to sign players in Cuba and is awaiting a response. Approval would permit MLB to negotiate a player-transfer agreement with the Cuban Baseball Federation.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Cuba has embraced baseball as its national game since the late 19th century, and the passion is shared by Fidel Castro, a baseball aficionado and former pitcher in recreational baseball.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/>
