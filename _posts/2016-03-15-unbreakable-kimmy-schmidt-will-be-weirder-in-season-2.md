<p>The <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/01/orphan-blacks-season-4-teaser/" target="_blank">last time</a> we brought you a trailer for <em>Orphan Black</em> Season 4, the many clones played by Tatiana Maslany were going down a rabbit hole of C-4 and suspense. This time around things are a little more fun. (OK, there’s still a lot of screaming and near-death moments.) Set to a crazy beat and intercut with scenes of nightclubs, snaps, and dancing. There are also body bags, mysterious files from the Dyad Institute, and what appears to be Alison and Donnie’s attempts to have a child, possibly with the help of Helena. Anyway, it’s a doozy. Check it out above. <em>Orphan Black</em> is back on BBC America on April 14.  </p>
<p><strong>Pause at:</strong> 0:03 for bomb stuff. 0:19 for the best moment of this trailer. 0:28 for clubbin’. 0:43 for that creepy rabbit mask’s return. 0:37—Felix (Jordan Gavaris) what did you <em>do</em>?!<br/><strong>Essential Quote:</strong> “I’m late for my own pregnancy.”—Sarah (Maslany) pretending to he Alison? Alison pretending to be Helena? Another clone entirely? We don’t know, but it’s a LoL.  </p>
