                    <p> Yale University will scrub the title of "master" for faculty who work in the residential colleges — but it will not change the name of its college honoring John C. Calhoun, a white supremacist politician and strong proponent of slavery in the 19th century. </p>

                  </figure><p> University President Peter Salovey said Wednesday that keeping the name Calhoun College forces the campus to confront the nation's slave-owning past — and learn from it. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> "Through teaching and learning about the most troubling aspects of our past, our community will be better prepared to challenge their legacies," Salovey said in a statement. "More than a decision about a name, we must focus on understanding the past and present, and preparing our students for the future." </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> The faculty, however, decided they should no longer be referred to as "masters," contending it"no longer felt it appropriate to be addressed in this way," <a href="http://news.yale.edu/2016/04/27/yale-retains-calhoun-college-s-name-selects-names-two-new-residential-colleges-and-change">according to the school</a>. Those faculty members will instead be addressed as the "head of college." </p>
                
              
                    
              
              
                    <p> Salovey added that Yale will name two new undergraduate residential colleges opening next year after Benjamin Franklin and Pauli Murray, a civil rights activist and the first black woman to be ordained as an Episcopal priest. </p>
                
              
              
              
                
              
              
              
                
                    
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Schools across the country have seen protests over legacies that seem to honor controversial figures. At Yale, the opposition to Calhoun — the seventh vice president of the U.S. and a South Carolina senator — reached a fever pitch after the <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/charleston-church-shooting">shooting massacre last June</a> at a historically black church in Charleston. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Princeton University on Wednesday said it would not remove President Woodrow Wilson's name from two buildings on campus, but it would take down a picture of him in a dining hall. Wilson, a graduate of the Ivy League school, has been criticized for his poor civil rights record. </p>
                
              
                    
              
              
                    <p> Earlier this year, Harvard University announced that faculty who oversee undergraduate dorms at the school will <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/after-debate-harvard-university-will-no-longer-use-term-house-n525576">no longer be called "House masters." </a>The decision was made in response to concerns from the campus that the term evoked slavery. </p>
