<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">PARIS</span> Talks between Orange (<span id="symbol_ORAN.PA_0">ORAN.PA</span>) and Bouygues (<span id="symbol_BOUY.PA_1">BOUY.PA</span>) on a deal to create a dominant French telecoms operator collapsed on Friday, ending an attempt to ease a price war that has ravaged operators' margins.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The failure of the proposed 10 billion euro ($11.4 billion) cash-and-share deal involving Bouygues Telecom is a blow to the two companies and the French government, which was heavily involved as it has a stake of around 23 percent in Orange.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The proposed tie-up was widely seen as a make-or-break chance to reduce the number of telecoms groups to three from four and prop up profits, which have been depressed since the arrival of low-cost operator Iliad.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>But a stand-off between Martin Bouygues and French Economy Minister Emmanuel Macron about the clout the billionaire would have gained in the former state monopoly had weighed on the talks, sources had told Reuters earlier.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>"The two main reasons explaining the failure of these talks are execution risks and the general attitude of the French state," a source close to the matter told Reuters.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>The risks included the break-up fees involved and the conditions under which each party involved would have been able to withdraw from the deal, the source added. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Orange's position as the No. 1 French telecoms operator meant that an acquisition of Bouygues Telecom would have required selling some of its assets to rivals Iliad (<span id="symbol_ILD.PA_2">ILD.PA</span>) and SFR (<span id="symbol_NUME.PA_3">NUME.PA</span>), with which Orange held parallel negotiations.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>This added to the complexity of getting a deal done, sources said, as apart from Bouygues himself, the talks involved two other influential billionaires, Iliad's founder Xavier Niel and SFR's owner Patrick Drahi.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>"It would have been a miracle if they had come to terms," a source close to the matter said. </p><span id="midArticle_9"/><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>GOING IT ALONE</p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The failure to reach a deal, which was confirmed by both parties, leaves Bouygues Telecom to go it alone.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>"In a market where the possibility of consolidation is now ruled out for the long term, Bouygues Telecom will continue its standalone strategy," Bouygues, the construction-to-media conglomerate said in a statement.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>That could prove difficult for them, Francois Mallet, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux, said.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>"They will all be kicking themselves," Mallet said on BFM Business, adding: "The state has a big responsibility in this. The big loser is Bouygues, let's not kid ourselves."</p><span id="midArticle_15"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>A source at the French Economy Ministry said that the main hurdle had been the risks involved in getting a deal across the line, with competition concerns a factor.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>"It was an extremely complex deal and there was the question of the competition authority hanging," the source told Reuters.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The tie-up would have made Bouygues the second-biggest shareholder of Orange after the French state, whose stake would have been diluted.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The French Economy Ministry had asked Bouygues to accept capping its potential stake in Orange for seven years, under a so-called standstill clause.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>It had also asked it to accept giving up for 10 years the double-voting rights Bouygues would get as a long-term investor in Orange, another source said.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><span id="midArticle_5"/><p> (Reporting by Mathieu Rosemain, Gwenaelle Barzic, Michel Rose and Sophie Sassard; Editing by David Evans and Alexander Smith)</p><span id="midArticle_6"/></div>
