<br><div id="start-of-content"><article class="content link-underline relative body-copy border-b pad-b-50" data-js="content" itemprop="articleBody" readability="37.428872497366"><p><iframe width="590" height="332" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rCUfvemx3D0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/><br/>Yesterday was a good one for Marvel fans. Not only did they get the second season of <em>Daredevil</em> on Netflix, but those who watched all 10 episodes made it to an unexpected dessert course: the first official teaser for <em>Luke Cage</em>. In the spot, Cage takes on two gun-wielding toughs in a boxing gym—and these guys clearly never watched <em>Jessica Jones</em>, or else they might have known about the Cage match they had coming. (This one had 36 hits: two clips’ worth of bullets hitting Cage, one thug hitting a window, and Nas’ hit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhPtRA7zieE" target="_blank">“Made You Look”</a> hitting your ears.) The second nice surprise? We’d known the next show in Marvel’s street-level lineup would be coming to Netflix sometime in 2016, we just figured we’d have longer to wait than September 30.</p>
<p><strong>Pause at:</strong> :10, for Mike Colter’s Cage uttering the rare wry line post-bulletstorm—“I’m about sick of always havin’ to buy new clothes.”</p>
