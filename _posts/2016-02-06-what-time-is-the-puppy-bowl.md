<br><div id=""><p>You may have some questions about the Puppy Bowl. Questions like, What time is the Puppy Bowl? What is the Puppy Bowl? How does the Puppy Bowl work? Who’s playing in the Puppy Bowl? What channel is the Puppy Bowl on?</p>
<p>These are good questions, especially the first one. Sometimes knowing the starting time of an event or activity is important. That way, you can view or attend the event without missing a moment of the action contained therein. When you know the starting time of an event or activity, such as dinner time or calypso time or the time the waterslide park opens, you can keep it in mind when you look at a clock. If the starting time and the clock time match, do you know what time it is? It’s “time” to enjoy the event!</p>
<p>So what time does the Puppy Bowl start? Easy: <a href="http://www.animalplanet.com/tv-shows/puppy-bowl/" target="_blank">Puppy Bowl XII</a> will take place on Sunday, Feb. 7, 2016, at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time or noon Pacific Time. It will start at 2:00 p.m. if you are in the Central Time zone.</p>
<p>Some more answers: Puppy Bowl XII will be on the television. It will be on the television station called <a href="http://www.animalplanet.com/" target="_blank">Animal Planet</a>. You can also watch it on a <a href="http://www.animalplanet.com/tv-shows/puppy-bowl/">normal computer</a> or even a face computer, because Puppy Bowl XII will be <a href="http://www.animalplanet.com/tv-shows/puppy-bowl/games-and-more/puppy-bowl-virtual-reality/">shown in virtual reality this year</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re not a puppy, you cannot play in the Puppy Bowl. <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CPmkr33UcAE7ArS.jpg" target="_blank">Sorry, Joe.</a> But there is still a way to be alarmingly competitive when you are watching the Puppy Bowl. You can draft your own <a href="http://www.puppybowlfantasy.com/" target="_blank">fantasy Puppy Bowl team</a> for the game. You should definitely use <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/02/how-to-draft-the-ultimate-puppy-bowl-fantasy-team/" target="_blank">this Puppy Bowl fantasy team draft guide</a>, which was written by a true expert. There are a lot of bogus Puppy Bowl fantasy draft guides out there, written by charlatans. <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2016/2/5/10920364/puppy-bowl-time-starting-lineup-fantasy-animal-planet" target="_blank">Like this one.</a></p>
<p>But maybe you’re wondering, “what are puppys?”</p>
<p>Unlike the concept of time, this one gets really confusing right away. Puppys are, in fact, nothing at all. Now, you may view this statement as some kind of nihilistic proclamation, a dismissal of the entire nature of being. Nothing could be further from the truth. It’s not a statement to be taken in a ruminative sense, as it has nothing to do with your faith nor your existential leanings. Likewise, it does not infer that the objects in question are quadrupedal Sisyphean totems, bounding and face-licking their way toward an ultimately repetitive and futile existence. It’s naught but a question of semantics, dear reader.</p>
<p>Instead, a singular noun ending in a consonant and “y” usually goes through a change when it’s converted to a plural form. In this case, “puppys” isn’t even a word. It’s “puppies.”</p>
