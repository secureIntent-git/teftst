<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocatio&lt;/span&gt;n">The U.S. Federal Communications Commission may approve a $2 billion a year budget cap as part of an expansion of a subsidy for low-income Americans for phone and Internet services though last minute discussions could derail the deal, two sources briefed on the talks said.</span></p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>At least three of the five commissioners had agreed to the deal early on Thursday, sources said, but its fate remains in doubt after the FCC took the unusual step of twice delaying the start of its meeting by 90 minutes as talks continue before the meeting, now set to start at 1:30 p.m. EDT .</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>At issue is FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler's proposal unveiled earlier this month to expand the $9.25 monthly mobile phone subsidy to include broadband Internet access.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Republicans have pushed for a budget cap for the $1.5 billion annual program, called Lifeline, which has helped lower-income Americans get access to telecommunications technologies since 1985. There is currently no cap. </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Wheeler has said he wants to give those receiving the subsidy a choice of using it for phone services, high-speed Internet, or both. But households will get only a single $9.25 per month subsidy that would apply to both services. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The program currently helps about 12 million U.S. households afford landline and mobile phones, according to agency estimates.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Wheeler had proposed setting a budget of $2.25 billion a year, indexed for inflation, for the program. The extra funds would allow more than 5 million additional households to take advantage of the program.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The FCC estimates that some 95 percent of U.S. households with incomes of at least $150,000 have access to high-speed Internet, while less than half of households with incomes lower than $25,000 have Internet access at home.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>The proposal requires phone providers to offer unlimited talk time for all plans for subsidy users after December 2016, and by the end of 2019 providers would have to offer both phone and broadband services to qualify under the program.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>FCC Commissioner Michael O'Rielly said this month Wheeler's proposal would "massively expand the size and scope" and "balloon a program plagued by waste, fraud, and abuse."</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, a Senator from Vermont, urged the FCC to act on the program.  </p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>"Broadband access is a necessity, not a luxury. I urge the FCC to expand Lifeline and help millions of working families get online," he said Thursday.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><p> (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Alan Crosby)</p><span id="midArticle_14"/></div>
