The escort vessels will later sail to Vietnam's strategic Cam Ranh Bay base on the South China Sea, the source said.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>"It sends a message. It is important for Japan to show its presence," the person with knowledge of the plan said on Monday. He asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to talk to the media.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>A Japanese Ministry of Defence spokesman declined to comment on any submarine visit but said the navy normally conducted training voyages in March and April. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"But we are still in the planning stage so are unable to provide details," he said.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The visits were first reported by Japanese media, including the Sankei newspaper, on Sunday.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Asked about the visits, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said Japan occupied the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea during World War Two so China was on "high alert" for Japan's military moves there.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>"The cooperation of relevant countries should benefit regional stability and should not be directed at third parties or harm another country's sovereignty or security interests," he told a daily news briefing in Beijing.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>

        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Rather than confronting China in such a direct way, Japan instead wants to build the capacity of nations in the region to improve their surveillance of Chinese forces. Japan's Minister of Defence Gen Nakatani is due to travel to the Philippines in April to discuss cooperation.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>Japan has already offered to supply the Philippines with aircraft that will help bolster patrols over the disputed sea.
