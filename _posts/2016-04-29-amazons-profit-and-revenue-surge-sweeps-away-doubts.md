        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Revenue in Amazon's three main businesses - online retailing in North America, international online retailing, and cloud business Amazon Web Services (AWS) - swelled 27 percent, 26 percent and 64 percent respectively.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>The company also offered a bright outlook, with revenue guidance for the current quarter of $28 billion to $30.5 billion, compared with the $28.33 billion analysts expected.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>AWS, launched 10 years ago, delivered more profit in the first quarter than Amazon's retail business.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>While AWS is Amazon's fastest-growing business, Amazon Prime and Marketplace, where the company acts as a middleman for third-party vendors, are also gaining momentum.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>"On the retail side, Prime is the driver," wrote Macquarie Research analyst Ben Schachter, who raised his target to $760 from $725 while maintaining an "outperform" rating.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>PRIME TIME</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>Amazon's Prime loyalty program offers one-hour delivery, original TV programming and access to digital entertainment products such as Prime Music and Prime Video for an annual $99.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>"In both North America and International, Prime continues to thrive and we believe continued investment in original content, expansion in existing markets and the still-large opportunity to add new markets offers lots of runway," BMO Capital Markets analysts Daniel Salmon and William Lowden wrote.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>BMO, which maintained its "outperform" rating on the stock, raised its price target to $800 from $700.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>At least 22 brokerages raised their price targets, to a median of $777.50. JP Morgan was the most bullish with a target of $915, an increase from $822.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>At that price, Amazon would be valued at $432 billion, making it the third-largest U.S.-listed company by market value, behind Apple Inc (<span id="symbol_AAPL.O_1">AAPL.O</span>) and Google parent Alphabet Inc (<span id="symbol_GOOGL.O_2">GOOGL.O</span>), both of which posted disappointing quarterly results.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>At current prices, Amazon is valued at about $317 billion, up about $35 billion from Thursday's close.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Amazon shares, which have gained 40 percent in the past year, trade at 98.7 times forward earnings, indicating that investors see huge potential for more growth. Apple trades at 10.8 times earnings, while Alphabet trades at 19.9 times.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>However, to justify Amazon's current share price, Amazon's earnings per share will have to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 90 percent over the next five years, according to StarMine. Such abnormally high growth rates have proven to be difficult to sustain over long periods.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Of the 44 analysts covering the stock, 39 rate it "buy" or higher and five "hold", according to Thomson Reuters data.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><span id="midArticle_10"/><p> (Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty; Editing by Ted Kerr)</p><span id="midArticle_11"/></div>
