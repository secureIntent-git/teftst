<br><div id="start-of-content"><article class="content link-underline relative body-copy" data-js="content" itemprop="articleBody" readability="55.384615384615"><p>This week, Twitter has begun rolling out <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/06/twitters-new-stickers-snapchat-filters-tweets/">a new feature</a>: stickers.</p>
<p>Behold!</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" readability="5.4183673469388"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This stickers thing, I like it <a href="https://t.co/0dbFfQxdyy">pic.twitter.com/0dbFfQxdyy</a></p>

<p>While stickers are cute, fun, and engaging for tech-addled millennials, they’re more than mere decoration. Twitter’s stickers have utility. They make searching for photos much, much easier.</p>
<p>Twitter’s search function now can search for content based on stickers that you added to your photo. So if you added a pile a vegetable stickers to a photo of pizza, you can search using ????, and Twitter will return any of your photos with that sticker on it. You can start tagging photos with stickers to organize your archives and to make everything easier to find in the future. You used to have to flip through your media feed backwards chronologically, viewing dozens of pictures before getting to the one hilarious license plate you tweeted two years ago.</p>
<p>Beyond just your own photos, stickers work just like hashtags. You can find photos posted by other people who are using the same stickers by tapping the sticker’s image in the photo. For example, you can see a real-time feed of everyone who added a ????  to a picture of a crazy traffic jam. It’s pretty innovative, and opens the doors to new ways of exploring Twitter and making new voices and reactions go viral.</p>
<p>The feature will be showing up in your official Twitter client soon, but like all Twitter enhancements, it will roll out slowly. So once you get stickers on Twitter, use them like a pro.</p>
