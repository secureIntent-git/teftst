<p>Star Wars nerds and <em>Hamilton</em> geeks tend to fill two fairly different subreddits. But today, <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em> director J.J. Abrams and <em>Hamilton</em> creator Lin-Manuel Miranda joined (ahem) forces to create something that both groups can mutually freak out over.</p>
<p>As a horde of <em>Hamilton</em> fans waited outside the theater today, hoping to score a ticket to the show through its Ham4Ham lottery, Miranda and Abrams surprised fans with a live performance of the song “Jabba Flow,” from <em>The Force Awakens</em>. Miranda and Abrams co-wrote the song, which Miranda says is written in “Huttese.” </p>
<p>“I went to a website that had all the Huttese glossary of terms and it translates as, ‘No, lover, lover. It wasn’t me,'” Miranda told screaming the crowd. “It’s literally a Shaggy intergalactic remix.”</p>
<p>Because demand for <em>Hamilton</em> is so high (and tickets are so good-god expensive) Miranda and his fellow cast members regularly treat eager fans to a live performance outside the theater. That way, even the people who don’t get a ticket don’t go home empty-handed. But, Miranda and Abrams arranged today’s Ham4Ham show specifically for May the Fourth, aka Star Wars Day. </p>
<p>“Jabba Flow” is available now on StarWars.com and iTunes, but really, all you need is right here in this video. Enjoy.</p>
