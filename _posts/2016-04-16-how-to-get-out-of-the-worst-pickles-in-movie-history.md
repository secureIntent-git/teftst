<br><div id="start-of-content"><p>In the indie thriller <em>Green Room</em>, which hits theaters this weekend, the members of a DIY punk band find themselves trapped in a rock venue’s dressing room by the club’s owners—a group of skinheads led by Patrick Stewart. The band must figure out a way to get out of the room, fight past the neo-Nazis, and make it to their van alive. Since the movie harkens back to other flicks with hostage or entrapment circumstances, we asked director Jeremy Saulnier and star Anton Yelchin how they’d get out of the situations depicted in other films from the genre. The escape plans they came up with involved selling their souls to the devil, Dolph Lundgren, and the Force. See what else they came up with above. </p>
