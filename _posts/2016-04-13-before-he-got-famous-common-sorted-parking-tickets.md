<br><div id="start-of-content"><p>Ever since Tracy Jordan popularized the term on <em>30 Rock</em>, everyone has been trying to get an EGOT. The acronym, which stands for “Emmy Grammy Oscar Tony,” is the ultimate grand slam for multi-hyphenate performers. So far, only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_who_have_won_Academy,_Emmy,_Grammy,_and_Tony_Awards" target="_blank">a dozen</a> have reached EGOT status, but if rapper-actor Common hits his goal, there will be one more.   </p>
<p>“That’s a great question, because I want to put that out there in the atmosphere,” the star of this weekend’s <a href="http://barbershopmovie.com/" target="_blank"><em>Barbershop: The Next Cut</em></a> says in the above Google Autocomplete interview. </p>
<p>He’s halfway there. Common already has an Oscar for “Glory,” the song he made with John Legend for <em>Selma</em>, and three Grammys. All he heeds now is a breakout performance on Broadway and a really good role on TV.  </p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, the Chicago-born MC and actor reveals he’s not a great cook and the origins of his name. Watch the whole thing above. </p>
