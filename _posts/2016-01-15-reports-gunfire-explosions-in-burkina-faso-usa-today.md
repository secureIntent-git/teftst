There were also multiple reports of several gunmen entering the building.</p><p>The U.S. Embassy in Ouagadougou <a href="https://twitter.com/Usembassyouaga/status/688105061558292480">said on Twitter</a> that it is "closely following the situation downtown."</p><p><span style="line-height:1.6">It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack, but jihadists have attacked hotels before in neighboring Mali, including a devastating attack on the Radisson Blu hotel in November that left 20 people dead. While Burkina Faso has largely been spared the violence wracked by Islamic extremist groups in Mali, a Romanian national was abducted last April.</span></p><p><span style="line-height:1.6">Witnesses told the BBC </span><span style="line-height:1.6">two car bombs exploded outside hotel before it was stormed by masked gunmen. </span>An Associated Press reporter near the scene said several cars were also ablaze at the site.</p><p>In addition, one witness told AFP that a nearby restaurant, The Cappuccino was also hit. Another unconfirmed <a href="https://twitter.com/B_Sai_Diallo">report on social media</a> said six bearded men wearing turbans and masks went into the hotel.</p><p>The attacks follows growing tension in the wake of a coup that collapsed September after only a week. The newly installed government recently issued an arrest warrant for Guillaume Soro, the head of the National Assembly in neighboring Ivory Coast, for his alleged involvement in the failed coup attempt, which was led by presidential guards.</p><div id="module-position-Ou3CjIfNCtM" class="story-asset oembed-asset"><div class="story-oembed-wrap "><div class="js-oembed story-oembed story-oembed-twitter story-oembed-type-rich" data-oembed-type="rich" data-oembed-provider="twitter" readability="20.571428571429"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" readability="4.5"><p lang="fr" dir="ltr">Attaque sur l'avenue Kwamé N'Krumah, des véhicules en feu devant l'hôtel splendide <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/lwili?src=hash">#lwili</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BurkinaFaso?src=hash">#BurkinaFaso</a><a href="https://t.co/OK6W5HxrEy">pic.twitter.com/OK6W5HxrEy</a></p>— Gugust (@Gugustt) <a href="https://twitter.com/Gugustt/status/688091693950840832">January 15, 2016</a></blockquote></div></div></div><p>In addition, new President Roch Marc Kabore broke with the past Wednesday by picking a cabinet packed with ministers who had not served under the previous administration of longtime leader Blaise Compaore, who was president for 27 years. Compaore went into exile in Ivory Coast after being ousted in a popular uprising in 2014.</p><p>The warrant was issued through Interpol and the foreign ministry, according to prosecutor Col. Sita Sangare, the Associated Press reported. It was not immediately clear if the latest unrest was directly related to the previous coup efforts.</p><p>Soro allegedly offered to give support to coup leaders in phone calls to Burkina Faso's former foreign affairs minister Djibril Bassole, Sangare said, adding the calls will be used as part of the prosecution. The calls, however, have not yet been authenticated.</p><p>Bassole was arrested and jailed at the end of September on accusations he helped support coup leader Col. Gilbert Diendere, who is also now jailed. Bassole has denied the allegations. Diendere has been charged with crimes against humanity for the deaths of 15 people and the wounding of about 250 others around the coup attempt.</p><p>Bassole was a high-ranking minister under former Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore, who is now in exile in Ivory Coast after being ousted in a popular uprising in October 2014.</p><!-- cxenseparse_end --><p>Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1RqD8pU</p></div>
