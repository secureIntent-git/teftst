The third-party hacks have Apple racing to strengthen its encryption technology.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Los Angeles police gained access to the iPhone of April Jace, the wife of "The Shield" actor Michael Jace, who is accused of shooting her to death, at their home in May 2014.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Police investigators learned on March 18 that a forensic cellphone expert, whose identity was not released, could "override the locked iPhone function" on April Jace's phone to extract data, Detective Connie Zych wrote in a search warrant affidavit. </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>That was around the time the U.S. government was locked in a legal battle with Apple over requests the company unlock the iPhone 5c used by Rizwan Farook, one of the shooters in the San Bernardino killings.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
