Busch, a district manager in the drinking water division, had already been suspended.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette told a news conference to announce the charges that it was "only the beginning and there will be more to come."</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>The three people charged could not immediately be reached for comment. Glasgow faces up to five years in prison and $6,000 in fines, while the two MDEQ officials each face up to 20 years in prison and $45,000 in fines, according to court documents.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Officials with the city of Flint and MDEQ could not be reached for comment.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Dena Altheide, a court administrator, said court dates and  arraignments had not been set. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Flint, which has about 100,000 people, was under control of a state-appointed emergency manager in 2014 when it switched its source of water from Detroit's municipal system to the Flint River to save money. The city switched back in October.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The river water was more corrosive than the Detroit system's and caused more lead to leach from its aging pipes. Lead can be toxic and children are especially vulnerable. The crisis has prompted lawsuits by parents who say their children are showing dangerously high blood levels of lead.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>In January, the attorney general named a special prosecutor to lead the investigation into whether criminal charges should be filed in the water crisis.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>In February, former Wayne County prosecutor Todd Flood, who has led the probe, said his team would look at what possible crimes were committed in the crisis.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>"The criminal charges against MDEQ officials are one step towards justice for the families of Flint who were poisoned as a result of the actions of Governor (Rick) Snyder’s administration," U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings, a Democrat from Maryland, said in a statement. </p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Cummings and other House Democrats have called for Snyder to step down because of the state's poor handling of the crisis, something the governor has said he would not do.    </p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Ari Adler, a spokesman for Snyder, said the governor has supported the probe "because the people of Flint and across Michigan are owed straight answers about how the Flint water crisis happened." The governor has said the state would pursue evidence of wrongdoing and hold people accountable.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><span id="midArticle_0"/><span id="midArticle_1"/><p> (Writing and reporting by Ben Klayman; additional reporting by Suzannah Gonzales in Chicago and Susan Cornwell and Susan Heavey in Washington; editing by Diane Craft)</p><span id="midArticle_2"/></div>
