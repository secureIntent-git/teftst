    </figcaption></figure><p>An experimental, solar-powered aircraft took off from Tulsa in the midwestern US state of Oklahoma early Saturday, kicking off the latest phase of its record-breaking quest to circle the globe without consuming a drop of fuel.

      </section><p>Swiss businessman Andre Borschberg, who has teamed up with adventurer Bertrand Piccard for the Solar Impulse 2 project, piloted the flight expected to last about 18 hours.</p>&#13;
<p>The plane, which aims to promote clean energy technologies, departed at 4:22 am (0922 GMT) from Tulsa International Airport and was due to land at Dayton International Airport, Ohio, hours later, at 11:00 pm (0300 GMT Sunday), project organizers said.</p>&#13;
<p>"The flight is part of the attempt to achieve the first ever Round-The-World Solar Flight, the goal of which is to demonstrate how modern clean technologies can achieve the impossible," they said in a statement.</p>&#13;
<p>"Watching Si2 silently lift off is beautiful. Science fiction in reality!" a logbook comment said on the project's website.</p>&#13;
<p>The journey kicked off in Abu Dhabi on March 9, 2015.</p>&#13;
<p>Thanks to an inflatable mobile hangar, which can be packed up quickly and transported, Solar Impulse 2 can be sheltered at a variety of locations.</p>&#13;
<p>The aircraft was grounded in July when its batteries were damaged halfway through its 21,700-mile (35,000-kilometer) circumnavigation of the globe.</p>&#13;

    </figcaption></figure><p>The crew took several months to repair the damage caused by high tropical temperatures during a 4,000-mile flight between Nagoya, Japan and Hawaii.</p>&#13;
<p>The plane was flown on that stage by Borschberg, whose 118-hour journey smashed the previous record of 76 hours and 45 minutes set by US adventurer Steve Fossett in 2006.</p>&#13;
<p>He took catnaps of just 20 minutes at a time to maintain control of the pioneering plane during the flight from Japan, in what his team described as "difficult" conditions.</p>&#13;
<p><b>How it works</b></p>&#13;
<p>The Solar Impulse 2, which weighs roughly the same as a family car but has wings wider than those of a Boeing 747, contains 17,000 solar cells that power the aircraft's propellers and charge batteries.</p>&#13;
<p>At night, the plane runs on stored energy.</p>&#13;

    </figcaption></figure><p>The typical flight speed is around 30 miles an hour, which can increase to double that when exposed to full sunlight.</p>&#13;
<p>After crossing the United States, the pilots are set to make a transatlantic flight to Europe, from where they plan to make their way back to their point of departure in Abu Dhabi.</p>&#13;
<p>Piccard, a doctor by training, completed the first non-stop round-the-world balloon flight in 1999.</p>&#13;
<p>His teammate Borschberg is no stranger to adventure—15 years ago he narrowly escaped an avalanche, and in 2013 he survived a helicopter crash with just minor injuries.
