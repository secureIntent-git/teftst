ago</p></span><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>* Nigeria's efforts to release them have yielded no result</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>* Boko Haram wages insurgency to set up Islamic state</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>* Conflict in north has displaced 2.1 million people

 (Adds Buhari's comments)</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>By Ulf Laessing and Alexis Akwagyiram</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>LAGOS/ABUJA, April 14 A video showing 15 of the
219 schoolgirls held by the jihadist group Boko Haram has added
pressure on the Nigerian government to secure their release,
after activists accused authorities of mishandling the case in
the two years since their mass kidnap.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Weeping parents identified the girls captured by Boko Haram
fighters, who want to establish an Islamist state in northeast
Nigeria and have waged a seven-year campaign of violence,
killing thousands of people and displacing two million.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>President Muhammadu Buhari, elected a year ago on a promise
to end endemic graft and crush the group, said in December the
government could talk to Boko Haram if credible representatives
emerged.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>In January he said the government was launching a new
investigation into the kidnapping, vowing to return the girls
captured at a school in the town of Chibok while taking exams.
But little has emerged since then.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>In the video, apparently taken in December and given to
government officials by Boko Haram as proof of life for the
negotiations, a person asks the 15 girls to say their names as
they stand quietly in two rows, wearing headscarves.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"I saw all the girls and they are Chibok girls," Esther
Yakubu, a parent of one of the abducted girls who saw the video
broadcast by CNN said. "I recognise some of them because we are
in the same area with them."</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Yakubu was marching with some 30 other parents and activists
to the presidential villa in the capital Abuja to demand the
government do more to return the girls. Police stopped them at
the road leading to the villa.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Witnesses to the kidnapping, Nigerian military and security
officials, Western diplomats and counter-terrorism experts blame
a series of failings by politicians and the military in dealing
with the militants, including a lack of co-ordination.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Information Minister Lai Mohammed told CNN the government
was still reviewing the video. When asked about efforts to get
the girls released he only said: "There are ongoing talks."</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>A top government official who declined to be named, said an
official reaction would only be made once the military had
established the video's authenticity.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Buhari said in a statement he hoped the girls would be
"rescued", suggesting the army will try to liberate them.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>"Thousands of persons, mostly women and children, who were
kidnapped by Boko Haram, have already been rescued and reunited
with their families," he said, without mentioning the video.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>Buhari said he "continues to believe that with the total
commitment of the Federal Government, Nigerian Armed Forces and
security agencies...the girls will be eventually rescued."</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><span id="midArticle_2"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>INFORMATION "LOST"</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Activists said Buhari's government is not doing enough,
urging the state to use the video for clues to find the girls
and speak to girls who had managed to flee Boko Haram captivity.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>"The incredible wealth of information that victims of
terrorists can offer our security forces is being lost in the
current undefined and ineffective approach," Aisha Yesufu of the
#BringBackOurGirls group said in a statement.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Buhari has blamed his predecessor Goodluck Jonathan who was
slow to react to the abduction.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Under Buhari's command, Nigerian troops backed up by Chad,
Niger and Cameroon have recaptured most of territory held by
Boko Haram, which pledged allegiance to Islamic State last year.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>However, Boko Haram has no unified leadership which makes it
difficult for the government to find someone to negotiate with,
analysts say.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau appeared in a video
circulated last month in which he seemed to suggest he was
ailing and Boko Haram was losing its effectiveness. But another
video emerged last week saying there would be no surrender.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Fulan Nasrullah, a security analyst, said there was little
chance of a breakthrough in the talks between the government and
the militants after the failure of previous efforts.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>"The government is angry about the leak, as are the
insurgents," he said. "The insurgents are not currently willing
to negotiate for the girls following the government's alleged
bad faith in previous negotiations," he said.
