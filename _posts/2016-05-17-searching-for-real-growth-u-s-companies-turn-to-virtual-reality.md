<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="2"><p><span class="articleLocation">NEW YORK</span> A growing number of U.S. companies are counting on virtual reality for real profits.  </p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>With growth hard to come by amid the lethargic economy, companies ranging from snowmobile manufacturers to furniture sellers are incorporating virtual reality that so far has mostly been found in video games. Their bet: that the trendy headset-based technology can help them build sales and cut costs.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Theme park operator Six Flags Entertainment Corp (<span id="symbol_SIX.N_0">SIX.N</span>) is outfitting riders on some of its aging roller coasters with Samsung VR headsets, allowing the company to brand the rides as brand-new without having to build costly new attractions. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Snowmobile manufacturer Arctic Cat Inc (<span id="symbol_ACAT.O_1">ACAT.O</span>) has developed virtual reality rides that customers can use to try out new models at dealerships, while eBay Inc's (<span id="symbol_EBAY.O_2">EBAY.O</span>)  StubHub is testing technology that allows fans to check out the view from different seats before buying tickets.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>In the most recent round of corporate earnings reports, some 38 companies - including the New York Times Co (<span id="symbol_NYT.N_3">NYT.N</span>), GoPro Inc (<span id="symbol_GPRO.O_4">GPRO.O</span>), and furniture-seller Wayfair Inc (<span id="symbol_W.N_5">W.N</span>) - highlighted virtual reality as a part of their business plans. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>That was a 375 percent jump from the 8 that did so at this time last year, according to a Reuters analysis of earnings calls transcripts. Nearly all were either consumer or technology companies, suggesting that virtual reality technology has a ways to go before becoming mainstream.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The increasing focus on virtual reality comes at a time when first-quarter earnings for the S&amp;P 500 are expected to fall 5.4 percent from the same time last year, while second-quarter earnings are expected to fall 3.4 percent from the year before, according to Thomson Reuters estimates. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Yet for all of the enthusiasm, there is little evidence that virtual reality can deliver substantial growth. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"It is complementary to places like Six Flags, I would suspect, but not a game changer," said Brain Smoluch, a principal at Hood River Capital Management who owns shares in Himax Technologies Inc (<span id="symbol_HIMX.O_6">HIMX.O</span>), which makes semiconductors used in virtual reality displays. </p><span id="midArticle_9"/><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>FEW PURE PLAYS</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>There are few pure plays for investors who want to buy into virtual reality. </p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Facebook Inc (<span id="symbol_FB.O_7">FB.O</span>), which paid $2 billion for its Oculus virtual reality division in 2014 and began shipping its first $599 Oculus Rift headsets in March, has the best-known virtual reality head gear, though other well-known companies including Google's parent Alphabet Inc (<span id="symbol_GOOGL.O_8">GOOGL.O</span>) and Apple Inc (<span id="symbol_AAPL.O_9">AAPL.O</span>) are rumored to be working on high-powered headsets of their own. Neither company returned requests to comment. </p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Virtual reality is such a small part of Facebook's business that most analysts do not break out Oculus in their revenue or earnings estimates. Nor did Facebook give any numbers on how many Oculus headsets it expects to sell on its most recent earnings call.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>"This is very early and we don't expect VR to take off as a mainstream success right away ... but eventually we believe that VR is going to be the next big computing platform and we're making the investments necessary to lead the way there," Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>Some analysts, however, already are seeing a boost to the companies they cover. </p><span id="midArticle_0"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>"I don't think it's possible to break out (the benefit of VR technology) with any sort of precision," said Tyler Batory, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott who covers Six Flags. "But I can tell you that I think they are going to report record results this year because their growth rate is accelerating, and the growth rate wouldn't be accelerating if they didn't have it."</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Outfitting riders with VR headsets is much cheaper than building an entirely new roller coaster, he added, while only requiring three additional employees - two to disinfect the headsets after each ride and one to make sure riders have them on correctly. </p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Companies that incorporate virtual reality technology now could spur consumer interest, which should lead to further adoption rates by their competitors, said Michael Cuggiono, a portfolio manager at San Francisco-based Permanent Portfolio funds.  </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>As a result, he's been buying shares of Facebook, whose Oculus technology could become the industry standard.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>"It's cost-effective, it's efficient, and it helps you avoid some of the problems that come with adding new employees," he said. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><span id="midArticle_6"/><p> (Reporting by David Randall; editing by Linda Stern and Phil Berlowitz)</p><span id="midArticle_7"/></div>
