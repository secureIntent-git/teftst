<p>Super-complicated watches usually leverage their labyrinthine mechanical guts to do something special: display the phase of the moon, function as a stopwatch, chime the time on demand, and more. This watch, however, musters its 390 hand-crafted components to make the second hand jump through its 60 increments instead of sweep. Super unusual! The hallmark of a mechanical watch—a point of boasting, even—is traditionally its sweeping second hand; why undo that? “It’s more accurate,” says a master watchmaker at A. Lange &amp; Sohn, who declined to give his name because that is how things are done here in Fantasyland. The idea is that if you’re timing something—your pulse, the bloom on a cup of hipster coffee, how long your servant takes to arrive with your Campari and Soda—the precision of a jumping second is ideal.</p>
<p>Another feature in pursuit of accuracy: When you pull the crown out, the second hand resets to the 12 o’clock position; so when you push it back in, the watch starts at the exact minute you selected. That may seem like a small detail, but it required roughly 90 parts to achieve. </p>
<p>And while many high-end mechanical watches feature a power reserve indicator that shows how much time you have left before  you need to wind it again, this one takes a simpler approach: A red triangle appears in the center of its face when you’re ten hours from empty. Like the low-fuel light on your car. Except this costs more than your car: €78,800.</p>
<p>Lange is one of the few German watchmakers at SIHH, but they’re also one of the coolest manufacturers here. Founded in 1845 in Glashütte, Germany, Lange produced killer watches for more than a century. The company’s location, unfortunately, was almost its undoing. Glashütte was in East Germany, near Dresden; in 1948 the Soviet government seized Lange’s property and buildings, and shut the company down. It sat abandoned until 1990, when the founder’s great-grandson brought the company back to life. How can you not root for these guys? Today they’re considered some of the best watchmakers in the world. </p>
