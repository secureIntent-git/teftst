        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"If Donald Trump wins (Iowa), it's going to be a snowball to hell," Beck said.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Their comments came on the day The Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest and most influential newspaper, was to announce who it is endorsing for both the Republican race for a presidential nominee but also the Democratic battle between Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>The potential for more chaos in what has been a turbulent race on both the Republican and Democratic sides emerged on Saturday with the news that former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg might launch an independent run for president.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>A source said part of Bloomberg's concern was the problems that Clinton is having in defeating Sanders.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Trump has been a difficult target for criticism from his rivals because not all of his supporters are conservatives and many are most interested in his projection of strength, not where he stands on a particular issue.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>The latest Reuters-Ipsos tracking poll had Trump pulling in 40.6 percent support of Republican voters nationally. A CNN/ORC poll has Trump up in Iowa with 37 percent to 26 percent for Cruz, who has led in some other Iowa polls.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>At a First In The Nation forum for candidates in Nashua, New Hampshire, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush was notably withering in his criticism of Trump, calling him a fake conservative with a liberal past and a tendency to insult people.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>He reminded voters of Trump's dismissal of Senator John McCain as not a hero because he got captured during the Vietnam War. McCain spent 5-1/2 years as a prisoner of war. He was a two-time winner of the New Hampshire primary and the 2012 Republican presidential nominee.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>"It is not strong to insult women. It is not a sign of strength when you insult Hispanics. It is not a sign of strength when you say that a POW was a loser because they got caught. John McCain is a hero. It is not a sign of strength disparaging the disabled in this country. It is not. It is a sign of deep insecurity and weakness," Bush said.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>(This version of the story corrects Trump quote in headline, paragraphs 1 and 4)</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><span id="midArticle_1"/><p> (Additional reporting by Dustin Volz in Washington and <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=alanawise&amp;">Alana Wise</a> in New Hampshire; Editing by <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=sandra.maler&amp;">Sandra Maler</a>)</p><span id="midArticle_2"/></div>
