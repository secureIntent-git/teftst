      --> <p>CAIRO—Five years ago, massive street protests swept out Egypt’s strongman president and changed the course of the nation. Now, its authoritarian government, in an effort to avoid any resurgence of unrest, is clamping down on its critics and signaling that public displays of dissent won’t be tolerated.</p> <p>The regime of President <!--

Why do you want to ruin the nation?” Mr. Sisi said late last month, addressing his critics in a televised speech. “I came by your will and your choice and not despite it.”</p> <p>Egypt’s interior ministry didn’t respond to requests to comment.</p> <p>Eleven days after Tunisians forced out their longtime president with sustained street demonstrations, Web-savvy Egyptian activists joined the protests on Jan. 25, 2011, a public holiday known as Police Day. The demonstrations spread beyond the capital Cairo to Egypt’s heartland, forcing President <!--

      --> to resign. Similar unrest erupted in Libya, Yemen and Syria.</p> <p>Then Mr. Sisi, as military chief, orchestrated a 2013 coup that <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324436104578580864003593342" target="_self" class="icon none">unseated Egypt’s first democratically elected president</a>, the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohammed Morsi. He moved to designate the Brotherhood, Egypt’s largest opposition group, a terrorist organization. In the months that followed, Egypt introduced a law banning street protests.</p> <p>Some 40,000 people have been arrested for opposition to the government since 2013, according to the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights and other human-rights groups. Hundreds of Muslim Brotherhood officials and their supporters have been sentenced to death, including Mr. Morsi. The death sentences haven’t been carried out because of appeals.</p> <p>Following the passing of the stringent anti-protest law in 2013, police have been given a wide berth to use force to disperse crowds and arrest demonstrators, many of whom have been sentenced to prison terms of up to five years for participating in street marches. During weekly pro-Morsi rallies in 2013 and 2014, police often used live bullets resulting in deaths among the demonstrators. </p> <!--

But Egypt’s economic challenges—including double-digit inflation, stagnant civil-servant salaries and a sharp downturn in tourism—have eroded Mr. Sisi’s initial popularity.</p> <p>“The blank check of confidence in Sisi was borne out of a particular moment when people felt that the nation was at risk,” said <!--
        --> Heba Morayef,<!--
      --> the associate director of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, an independent human and legal rights group. “But with socioeconomic issues becoming the day-to-day priority again, it’s not an exaggeration to say there is growing discontent with the government.”</p> <p>The economic difficulties have been coupled with an Islamic State-inspired insurgency that had been confined to the Sinai Peninsula but has grown to include sporadic attacks in Cairo—a blow to Mr. Sisi’s image as a security-minded military man. On Thursday, seven police officers and three civilians were killed when explosives ignited during a police raid on an apartment the interior ministry said was being used by Islamist extremists near central Cairo, according to a statement from the interior ministry.</p> <p>The recent comments of Mr. Sisi’s government have taken some of his most ardent supporters by surprise.</p> <p>Youssef Al Husseiny, a presenter on private satellite channel OnTV and an outspoken opponent of Mr. Sisi’s critics, said in a recent broadcast that the president made a “grave mistake” by warning against protests in his December speech. “Why appear nervous or worried? Don’t give this any importance. Who told you that this needed to be mentioned in your speech?” Mr. Husseiny said in the broadcast. “Who really benefits from such a scenario where the state is depicted as worried and nervous?”</p> <p>Still, the state is taking no chances. At a recent communal Friday prayer in his suburban Cairo neighborhood, Hisham Abdel Razek admitted he was nearly dozing through the sermon being delivered by the mosque preacher when the imam’s words jolted him.</p> <p>“He began speaking about protests and how they undermine security,” said Mr. Abdel Razek, who is 32 years old. “Then he said security and patriotism were as important to worship as air and water are to human existence. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing.”</p> <p>The imam was following a script published earlier in the week by Egypt’s ministry of religious endowments, the body tasked with regulating mosques and their leadership. </p> <p>There have been no formal calls to mark the anniversary with mass demonstrations by any group in Egypt, and most Egyptians expect the anniversary to pass quietly. No reliable figures exist to gauge Mr. Sisi’s popularity as independent public opinion polling on Egyptians’ views of their government is banned.</p> <p>But individual members of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, mostly in exile, have urged their supporters to hit the streets. Small Facebook groups run by leftist activists have also appeared in recent months calling for another uprising on Jan. 25.</p> <p>Since December, Egyptian authorities have arrested administrators of 47 Facebook pages accusing them of inciting protests, while shuttering several cultural spaces where activists were known to gather, according to interior ministry statements. </p> <p>This week, police raided thousands of apartments near Tahrir Square, the epicenter of the 2011 uprising, according to local residents and activists familiar with the area. They have questioned residents and carried out searches at more than 5,000 homes in central Cairo, the Associated Press reported Thursday, citing security officials.</p> <p>Ms. Morayef said the “pre-emptive crackdown ahead of Jan. 25 is a strong signal to make sure no one forgets we are in zero-tolerance mode.”</p> <p>But as Egypt’s economy struggles, many are losing patience with Mr. Sisi.</p> <p>“Look, just a year ago I was one of those people who would scream ‘stop protesting, let the president do his job and move the country forward,’” said Yasser, a 47-year-old fruit and vegetable vendor in Cairo. “Now, I’m not saying I’ll go to streets on January 25th but I won’t be angry with anyone who does. We are suffering.”</p> <p> <strong>Write to </strong>Tamer El-Ghobashy at <a href="mailto:tamer.el-ghobashy@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">tamer.el-ghobashy@wsj.com</a> </p>
