<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocation">WASHINGTON</span> It's a U.S. taxpayer's dream: make the Internal Revenue Service go away, and the largest conservative group in Congress is endorsing just that.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The Republican Study Committee, which counts over two-thirds of House of Representatives Republicans as its members, called recently for "the complete elimination of the IRS."</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The committee's support for this idea, once confined to the fringes of conservative ideology, suggests it is more widely accepted on Capitol Hill than ever. But many in Washington, including some Republicans, have trouble taking it seriously.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Calls to abolish the IRS have not been well thought through, said Republican Representative Charles Boustany in an interview.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>“Before we start making blanket statements about abolishing the IRS, I think it’s important to focus on what the tax code for the 21st century should look like," said Boustany, who does not belong to the 172-member study committee.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>In an election year of dramatic rhetoric that is often short on details, the committee's proposal, released April 22 and echoing language from a March budget plan, is brief.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>As part of a wider appeal for federal tax reform, the committee says simply: "This proposal takes the bold step of calling for the complete elimination of the IRS. Tax collection and enforcement activities would be moved to a new, smaller and more accountable department at the Treasury."</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>No further specifics were offered for how to replace an agency that is already part of Treasury, collected $3.3 trillion in revenue in 2015, and processed 240 million tax returns.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Texas Representative Bill Flores, chairman of the study committee, was not available for comment. His spokeswoman Caitlin Carroll said the IRS closure proposal should be seen as part of a larger push for comprehensive tax reform.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute, a think tank , said, "We are in an election year, and bashing the IRS is particularly attractive in an election year."</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>From a global perspective, the IRS does a good job, Rosenthal said, noting that U.S. income tax compliance is about 82 percent, one of the highest levels in the world.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Still, in the United States, antipathy for the IRS is widespread and long-standing. One of Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz's biggest applause lines on the campaign trail is, "Imagine abolishing the IRS!"</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>'SOUNDS TRUMPISH'</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Asked recently about Cruz's line and calls to close the agency, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said: "If you want to call it something other than the IRS and that makes you feel better, that's okay with me. But ultimately you got to have somebody somewhere who collects the information, audits it and makes sure it’s accurate and valid and collects the funding."</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>Some Democrats scoff at the IRS closure proposal. "If there are problems at the IRS ... we can straighten it out," said Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings, adding Republicans should be wary of advocating an idea that "sounds Trumpish."</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>Donald Trump, the anti-establishment front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, has not called for the abolition of the IRS.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p> Congress has cut the IRS's budget 17 percent in real terms since 2010. In mid-April, the House approved several IRS-bashing bills, including one to prevent it from making new hires until Treasury certifies no agency employees are seriously delinquent on taxes themselves.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The IRS is a long-time congressional punching bag but Republicans have been hitting it harder since the IRS several years ago applied extra scrutiny to conservative groups' applications for tax-exempt status between 2010 and 2012 and came under attack for it from Republicans. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Republican Representative Rob Woodall of Georgia has introduced a bill every year since he entered Congress in 2011 to eliminate income taxes and abolish the IRS.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Support for Woodall's bill has grown to 73 co-sponsors, including the heads of the House tax and budget committees, but it has never advanced. Nor has a similar bill in the Senate.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>It was unclear how House Speaker Paul Ryan would treat the study committee's proposal in drafting a party policy agenda ahead of the Republican convention in Cleveland in July.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>"The speaker welcomes input from the RSC and all members of our conference," said Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong. Ryan has sidestepped calls for abolishing the IRS in the past, while frequently criticizing the agency.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><span id="midArticle_8"/><p> (Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and David  Gregorio)</p><span id="midArticle_9"/></div>
