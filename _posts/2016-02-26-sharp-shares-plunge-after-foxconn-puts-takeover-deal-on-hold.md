<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">TOKYO/TAIPEI</span> Shares in Sharp Corp (<span id="symbol_6753.T_0">6753.T</span>) plummeted on Friday after Taiwan's Foxconn put its takeover of the ailing Japanese electronics maker on hold, with sources saying previously undisclosed liabilities were responsible for the 11th hour delay.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Loss-making Sharp announced on Thursday it had decided to sell a two-thirds stake to Foxconn, a contract manufacturing firm formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co (<span id="symbol_2317.TW_1">2317.TW</span>) and major Apple Inc (<span id="symbol_AAPL.O_2">AAPL.O</span>) supplier.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Just hours later, Foxconn said it would not sign the deal until it had clarified some "new material information" from Sharp. It did not elaborate.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said the Japanese group had contingent liabilities that amounted to "hundreds of billions of yen."</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The sources, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter, did not elaborate on the nature of the liabilities or the exact amount. Reuters has not seen any documents regarding the new information.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>A spokesman for Foxconn declined to comment on the issue. Sharp also declined to comment.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>"That puts the entire deal in jeopardy," Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal said in a note to clients. "This is especially so given the dramatic back and forth that happened between Sharp and Foxconn in 2012, when Foxconn agreed to acquire a stake in Sharp but then later walked away."</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Sharp CEO Kozo Takahashi and Foxconn Chief Executive Terry Gou plan to meet on Friday in China, a person familiar with the matter said.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Shares in Sharp slid 15 percent on Friday morning, adding to losses a day earlier as planned share dilution under the deal looked larger than expected. The stock has fallen 28 percent over the past two days.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Foxconn's shares lost 1.9 percent on Friday.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>AIMING FOR APPLE BUSINESS</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The last minute hitch casts doubt on a deal that would have marked the conclusion to five years of courting by Gou and the opening up of Japan's insular tech sector to foreign investment.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>In a 31-page filing, Sharp said it would issue around $4.4 billion worth of new shares to give Foxconn a two-thirds holding. Foxconn's investment is set to total more than 650 billion yen ($5.8 billion), a separate source familiar with the matter said.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>If a deal does go through, it would boost Foxconn's position as Apple's main contract manufacturer and enable Sharp to start mass-producing organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screens by 2018, around the time Apple is expected to adopt the next-generation displays for its iPhones.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>OLED screens, which are thinner, lighter and more flexible than current displays and bringing Sharp under Foxconn's umbrella could help Apple wean itself off rival Samsung Electronics Co (<span id="symbol_005930.KS_3">005930.KS</span>) as a supplier.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>South Korea's Samsung Display and LG Display (<span id="symbol_034220.KS_4">034220.KS</span>) are also investing heavily in the new technology.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>But efforts to patch up the deal could be impeded by lingering distrust over the collapse of the 2012 deal to form capital ties. That distrust was one reason that some Sharp officials, until recently, preferred a lower offer by a state-backed fund, the Innovation Network Corp of Japan.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Analysts have said Sharp needs to find a buyer or secure some form of bailout by the end of March due to its weak finances.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Although the century-old Japanese firm was once a highly profitable manufacturer of premium TVs, it has struggled in recent years as massive investments in advanced liquid crystal display (LCD) plants failed to pay off due to fierce price competition with Asian rivals. Two bank bailouts since 2012 have failed to help turn its business around. </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><span id="midArticle_5"/><span id="midArticle_6"/><p> (Reporting by Ritsuko Ando and J.R.
