		<p>WASHINGTON - Virginia McLaurin's life isn't easy. Last winter, she battled bedbugs in her Washington, D.C., apartment. This year, mega-snowstorm "Snowzilla" trapped her inside for several days.</p>
<p>She also happens to be almost 107 years old.</p>
<p>None of that mattered last week, however, when the centenarian stepped - nay, scampered - into the Oval Office to meet <a href="http://topics.nola.com/tag/barack%20obama/">President Obama</a> and the first lady.</p>
<p>With the leader of the free world in one hand and Michelle Obama in the other, McLaurin danced with sheer and utter joy, shaking her hips like a 16-year-old and flashing a smile as bright as the camera flashes going off all around her.</p>
<p>"She's 106?" the president asked incredulously.</p>
<p>"No, you are not," scoffed the first lady, before adding: "I want to be like you when I grow up."</p>



<p>The uplifting moment was also heavy with history, however. After her super-senior shuffle, McLaurin suddenly got serious.</p>
<p>"I thought I would never live to get in the White House," said McLaurin, who was born in 1909 in South Carolina, worked as a seamstress for most of her life and has been a widow for more than 70 years.</p>
<p>But her amazement went beyond merely making it inside the hallowed building. She was particularly bowled over to be meeting America's first African American president.</p>
<p>"I tell you, I am so happy," she said, looking up at Obama before turning to the first lady. "A black president, yay, and his black wife."</p>
<p>McLaurin said she was there to celebrate Black History Month.</p>
<p>A video of the moving encounter was uploaded to the White House's Facebook page on Sunday evening and immediately went viral - with nearly 9 million views, roughly 282,000 likes and roughly 223,000 shares in less than 5 hours.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/02/4_takeaways_for_louisiana_from.html#incart_river_index_topics" data-enhanced="small">In other news: 4 takeaways for Louisiana from Obama's 2017 budget proposal</a></p>
<p>Commenters marveled at all that McLaurin had seen in her 106 years, and all that she and her country had endured during that time.</p>
<p>"She lived to see two World Wars, the height of racial segregation and finally an elected black president," wrote Alexandre Meister, before adding a parenthetical "hugs from Brazil."</p>
<p>And when one commenter said those praising the video were "sick," she was quickly overwhelmed by supporters.</p>
<p>"That woman saw children hanging from trees because of their color, so to see President Obama is a thrill," replied one woman. "If you don't get it, it's ok, but still your tongue until you do."</p>
<p>The Oval Office dance party was the culmination of more than a year of social media campaigns.</p>
<p>In December 2014, McLaurin submitted a petition to the White House asking to meet with the president.</p>
<p>"I've never met a President," she wrote. "I didn't think I would live to see a Colored President because I was born in the South and didn't think it would happen. I am so happy and I would love to meet you and your family if I could.</p>
<p>"I remember the times before President Hoover. I remember when we didn't have any electricity. I had a kerosene lamp. I remember the first car model Ford," she said. "My husband was in the Army. I lost my husband in 1941. I've been in DC ever since. I was living here when Martin Luther King was killed.</p>
<p>"I know you are a busy man, but I wish I could meet you," she concluded, offering to "come to your house to make things easier."</p>
<p>And that's just what she did one day last week after the Obamas apparently responded to her letter.</p>
<p>McLaurin cackled with glee as soon as she caught sight of the president.</p>
<p>"Hi," she said. "It's an honor. It's an honor."</p>
<p>"Slow down now, don't go too quick," Obama joked as McLaurin shuffled across the room to meet Michelle Obama.</p>
<p>"She's dancing," Obama said with a laugh. "So what's the secret to still dancing at 106?"</p>
<p>Instead of answering, McLaurin simply showed off her moves, earning laughter and squeals of delight from the Obama.</p>
<p>The memorable moment was not out of character for McLaurin.</p>
<p>"She has a flirtatious spirit and is a pure joy to be around," said Savetria Francis, the principal of a D.C. school where McLaurin volunteers, in a 2012 interview with the Afro-American newspaper. "For those of us who complain about commuting to work, neither rain, sleet, snow nor heat keeps Grandma Virginia from reporting to work."</p>
<p>"One of my secrets for longevity is reading the Bible and praying daily, loving Jesus Christ, and my fellow man," McLaurin said in 2014. "There's no one that I don't like; I love everybody."</p>
<p>A video on Facebook shows McLaurin playing with children, touching a tarantula and blowing out birthday candles with a boy nearly a century younger than she.</p>
<p>The last time McLaurin was in the news, however, it was a less joyous occasion. She was featured in a December 2014 report on bedbugs in her apartment building.</p>
<p>"They was in my couch, they was in my bedroom, so, that's why I don't have no furniture," she told ABC7.</p>
<p>Last week, however, McLaurin strolled across the Oval Office's plush carpet and posed in front of priceless presidential portraits.</p>
<p>Then she danced like she had been waiting a century to do it.</p>
<p>"You have just made our day, you know that?" Michelle Obama said. "That energy, man."</p>
<p>"You made my day," McLaurin answered.</p>
