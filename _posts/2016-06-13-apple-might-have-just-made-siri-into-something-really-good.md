<br><div id=""><p>iMessage is coming to Android. Let that sink in. </p>
<p>iMessage, Apple’s texting-only-better messaging app that is probably the single best reason to own an iPhone—or at least, not to jump ship—is coming to Android. No longer will iPhone users have to stare at those garish green bubbles signifying that the person on the other end of your messages is of a class wholly below your own. No longer will your messages get stuck in SMS Purgatory, maybe delivered but maybe not and you’ll never know. iMessage is coming to Android. If I keep saying it, maybe it’ll make sense.</p>
<p>Apple’s big messaging moves were among the biggest and most unexpected announcements of Tim Cook’s WWDC keynote Monday. Not only has iMessage not existed on Android before, it’s been actively hostile toward it. If you want to know what true frustration looks like, just ask anyone who’s ever switched from iOS to Android how many texts got lost in Apple’s servers.</p>
<p>Not that long ago, it seemed impossible that Apple would ever make apps for other platforms. Then there was Apple Music. And now? iMessage for everyone. No more pain points, no more phantom chats. It’s a big fat win for cross-platform conversations, without, at first glance, a ton of apparent upside for Apple.</p>
<p>It’s there, though. You just have to slightly shift your conception of Apple as a company, and of what really matters in today’s service-driven digital world.</p>
<h3>A Core Concern</h3>
<p>For years, decades even, Apple has been infamously insular: you’ve definitely heard that line about how it’s the best because it controls both the hardware and the software. But it’s not quite so simple anymore. Facebook Messenger isn’t an “app” in the traditional sense, it’s an ecosystem. A whole world, from app stores to payment structures, all happening within Apple’s devices but outside of its direct reach. It doesn’t matter which hardware you’re holding, what you’re using is Messenger. As apps and services continue to stress cross-platform harmony, Apple’s walled garden starts to look more like a co-op.</p>
<p>The new Apple, then, will succeed only if it not only hosts these full-stack, do-everything apps, but builds them as well. Apple Music is a small but useful example: from radio to downloads to curation to social networking, it’s everything you could ever need from music all in one comfortable little box. Or at least, it’s meant to be. Apple’s still working on the execution part. </p>
<p>Music made sense as first effort also because it offered Apple a small hedge, in the form of subscription revenue. Even if it was the one thing that let people migrate over to Android (it’s not), Apple would still collect a monthly tithe. iMessage is a much bigger step, if only because Apple doesn’t monetize it. </p>
<p>Still, there’s not as much risk to building bridges as there might seem. Apple’s hardware remains a huge advantage. Apple Music is better on an iPhone because it’s integrated with Siri. Siri is better than other iOS assistants because it’s right there when you hit the home button. And iMessage will be better on an iPhone because it’s better integrated with your phone, your contacts, your assistant, your email, and everything else. </p>
<p>In this way, it’s the same Apple as ever: the best because it controls both software and hardware. The difference now is, you can also get Apple’s software without the hardware, which maybe (maybe?) could entice a few Android users to hop ship back in the other direction. Current iPhone owners win as well. Now they get end-to-end encrypted messaging no matter who they’re talking to, and they can excise those green bubbles once and for all.</p>
<h3>Broader Appeal</h3>
<p>The tech industry is entering what you could call a post-hardware phase. It’s not that hardware doesn’t matter, really, it’s just that all hardware is good. Device lifespans are getting longer, so refresh cycles are going down. The race is now not just to sell you the phone, but to control the things you do on it. Better yet, to control the things you do elsewhere as well. </p>
<p>That’s what makes Apple desperate to be a compelling “software and services” company. To succeed, though, it has to create software people actually use on purpose. Increasingly, that means software that follows people wherever they go. Increasingly, if you’re not on every platform—and on Android in particular—you’re simply going to be forgotten. </p>
<p>Don’t be confused, iMessage is huge: Apple SVP and noted Golden State Warriors lunatic Eddy Cue said earlier this year that up to 200,000 iMessages are sent every second. That’s partly a matter of convenience, of course, since iPhones send iMessages by default. But iMessage is a huge, powerful texting platform in its own right. </p>
<p>Which is great, except texting is being replaced, by apps that are better and more powerful. Messaging is no longer just quick bursts of conversation, it’s the interface of the future. You can talk about the news with a chatbot, order an Uber or a pizza with a few taps, and shop at all your favorite stores from the comfort of a text box. There are more people using messaging services—WeChat, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and their ilk—than there are on social networks. These services are cross-platform, simple to use, and simple to develop for.</p>
<p>Most importantly, they all offer very compelling reasons not to use iMessage. And if you’re not using iMessage anymore, that’s all the less reason to buy an iPhone by default.</p>
<p>Even with all the new features and cross-platform love, iMessage isn’t going to suddenly drive WhatsApp and WeChat out of business. But it might keep hundreds of millions of iOS users happily inside Apple’s own ecosystem. It also helps establish a software foothold in critical developing markets, where Android still dominates and messaging apps reign supreme. And there’s one more slightly prosaic benefit: It prompts Android users who might have shunned iOS and OS X entirely to create Apple IDs. </p>
<p>iMessage has always been great because it’s a seamless texting experience—as long as you’re on iOS. Now that Apple’s smoothing out its cross-platform choppiness, it’s primed to be so much more. If you can use the same app for texting, sharing photos, paying your friends back, and navigating customer service without drowning in phone menus, why would you go anywhere else? Or maybe more to the point: Other messengers already let you do those things. If iMessage doesn’t, why stay?</p>
<p>The messaging wars are only beginning, and how far they’ll go is still hard to say for sure. But in one single move, Apple has a huge position of strength in the fight for your attention. All it had to do was learn to play nice with others.</p>
