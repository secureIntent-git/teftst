Analysts expect quarterly earnings of 8 cents per share on revenue of $1.79 billion. </p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Many investors are not waiting to see how the company fares against expectations. They're selling, pushing Tesla shares to a slightly more than two-year low on Monday, extending last week's decline of 15 percent after several analysts cut price targets or lowered revenue expectations. Shares closed down 9 percent on Monday, at $147.99.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Tesla shares are now down 33 percent from the price of the company's stock offering last August, valued at about $642.5 million, designed to replace cash that was burned funding engineering of new models and the construction of a battery factory in Nevada.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>One person not selling is Chief Executive Elon Musk, who exercised options worth about $100 million on Jan. 27 and held the shares.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>

        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>German competitors also are speeding up plans to offer luxury electric cars. Established automakers were slow to respond to Tesla's technological lead in offering customers new features via over-the-air software upgrades, for example, but others are now investing to catch up. </p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Tesla now faces "sleepy (auto) giants waking up," according to analysts Adam Hull and Paul Kratz from German bank Berenberg, who initiated coverage of Tesla with a "sell" rating.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><p> (Reporting by Alexandria Sage; Editing by <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=joe.white&amp;">Joe White</a> and Leslie Adler)</p><span id="midArticle_14"/></div>
