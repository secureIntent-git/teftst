<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="6"><p><span class="articleLocation">NINGBO, China</span> Two days before they sought asylum in South Korea, the North Korean waitresses in the Chinese coastal city of Ningbo shopped for backpacks at a nearby store and paid relatively expensive full prices.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>"I asked them 'Are you going on a trip?', and they said yes," said one of the workers at the shop, who declined to give his name. "They seemed happy."</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Another shop worker, surnamed Gong, confirmed the story. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Four waitresses from the Ryugyong Korean Restaurant visited the nearby store on April 5 and bought three backpacks, each for the listed 199 yuan (about $31), even though they were often known to bargain, the workers said.   </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Two days later, 12 of the restaurant's waitresses and one manager arrived in Seoul, the South Korean capital, in the biggest mass defection case involving North Koreans in several years.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>How they planned and executed their trip remains a mystery. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>South Korea has only said it has admitted 13 defectors, North Korean restaurant workers who arrived on April 7, on humanitarian grounds. The North has called it a "hideous" abduction of its workers by the South.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>China has said a group of 13 North Koreans used valid passports to leave the country normally on April 6, but did not say where they went.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>In Ningbo, shopkeepers nearby considered the North Korean restaurant and its pretty but secretive waitresses a curiosity.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>The restaurant, now closed, sits on a newly developed pedestrian street for tourists that opened for business in late September last year.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Across the lane at a cosmetics shop, Jiang Jiang recalled the noisy, patriotic North Korean music sung by the waitresses, a routine deployed at many of the around 130 North Korean restaurants around the world. Most remit revenues back to Pyongyang.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>"Not my style," she said. Moving her computer cursor between April 5 and 6 on a calendar, she added: "This is about when I stopped hearing the music. It was really loud music."Â </p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Some shopkeepers nearby said the restaurant appeared to have been closed for renovations several months ago, but stories varied. Business did not appear to be great.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>An employee of the company that manages the vintage-looking grey brick and wood buildings that line the pedestrian street, including the Ryugyong, said the workers were very secretive, and generally only seen outside when they were coming to and from work. </p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>"They were under military-like management, and not free to go anywhere," she said. Shopkeepers said sometimes they would shop for small items like hair bands.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>Typically, North Koreans working overseas are chosen for their loyalty but are subject to many restrictions. They usually live together and are guarded by security officials.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Xue Bin, one of the Chinese businessmen behind the restaurant, said he pulled out of the venture after a disagreement with a partner about six months ago.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Corporate records indicate that Xue is the legal representative of the venture, which is wholly owned by a man named Wang Qianqian. Wang declined to comment when reached by phone.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Xue confirmed that all the workers were imported from North Korea via Korean businessmen. Their salaries were paid directly to the workers in half-yearly increments. The North Koreans lived in a dormitory and were provided food, he said.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"We provided good conditions," he said by telephone from Beijing. "They had enough food. They had enough free time." </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Xue declined to say what the business disagreement had been about. He also said he had no idea how the staff had defected.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>"Maybe they paid someone. I don't know," he said.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><span id="midArticle_7"/><p> (Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)</p><span id="midArticle_8"/></div>
