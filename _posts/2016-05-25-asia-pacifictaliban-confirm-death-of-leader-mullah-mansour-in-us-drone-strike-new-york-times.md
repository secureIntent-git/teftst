Mullah Yaqoub is the son of the previous Taliban chief, Mullah Muhammad Omar, whose <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/31/world/asia/mullah-muhammad-omar-taliban-leader-afghanistan-dies.html">death was acknowledged</a> in July 2015.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="125" data-total-count="703">President Obama said Monday that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/24/world/asia/obama-mullah-mansour-taliban-killed.html">Mullah Mansour had been killed in a drone strike</a> Saturday in a restive province of Pakistan.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="264" data-total-count="967">The Taliban’s spokesmen, who publish regular updates from battlefields across <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/afghanistan/index.html?inline=nyt-geo" title="More news and information about Afghanistan." class="meta-loc">Afghanistan</a>, had remained silent since Mullah Mansour’s killing, as the movement’s leaders <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/25/world/asia/afghanistan-taliban-new-leader.html">convened in the Pakistani city of Quetta</a> to discuss his burial, as well as his successor.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="410" data-total-count="1377">One of their first meetings was at the home of Mawlawi Haibatullah, a figure with deep religious credentials who had been a lesser known deputy to Mullah Mansour. Over the past year, more attention had focused on another deputy, Mr. Haqqani, who had increasingly been running the day-to-day war for the Taliban as Mullah Mansour was occupied with a campaign of quashing internal dissent and with travel abroad.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="194" data-total-count="1571">Taliban commanders who were aware of the conversations in Quetta had described Mawlawi Haibatullah as a voice guiding the discussions of succession, but not as a front-runner for the leadership.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="369" data-total-count="1940">But many of the movement’s leaders had pushed for a relatively obscure figure to succeed Mullah Mansour — to avoid a divisive personality and for purposes of enhanced security, keeping in mind that Mullah Omar’s reclusive ways long protected him and even concealed his death for years. It appeared Wednesday that such criteria had served Mawlawi Haibatullah well.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="410" data-total-count="2350">Along with the announcement on Wednesday came the Taliban’s latest attack on the outskirts of Kabul, targeting a van that was taking employees of an appellate court to neighboring Wardak Province. The Taliban had vowed to take aim at government employees, particularly those in the judicial system, after six of their prisoners in Kabul were hanged recently, after having been convicted on terrorism charges.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="141" data-total-count="2491">Najibullah Danish, a deputy spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry, said 10 people had been killed in the attack and four others wounded.</p><a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#whats-next">Continue reading the main story</a>
