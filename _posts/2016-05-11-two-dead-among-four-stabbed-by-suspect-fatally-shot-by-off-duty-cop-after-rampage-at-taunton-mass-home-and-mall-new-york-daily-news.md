	A madman armed with a knife stabbed two people at a Taunton, Mass., home before hopping in his car, driving the vehicle into a storefront at a nearby mall and stabbing two more people at the shopping center, police said.</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	An off-duty law enforcement officer ended the threat by shooting the suspect, who later died, at the Silver City Galleria, Massachusetts State Police said Tuesday.</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	Two of the victims have also died, police said. It's unclear if the dead were from the scene at the private residence or the mall.</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	The incident began around 7 p.m. with the double stabbing on Myricks Street in the town just 25 miles east of Providence, R.I., and 40 miles south of Boston.</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	“It is possible that the assailant was involved in an earlier motor vehicle crash on Myrick Street prior to the stabbings there,” state police said in a statement.</p>         <!-- HTML Element: 7.2584325 -->              &#13;
<p>&#13;
	The deranged stabber then drove his car into a glass door at the Macy’s store at the mall and ran inside, where two more people were attacked by the knifeman, police said.</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	The off-duty cop was able to end the stop the rampage by shooting the suspect, cops said.</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	"I heard shots and saw cops loading AR-15s and I ran for my life," <a href="http://boston.cbslocal.com/2016/05/10/taunton-police-silver-city-galleria-shooting/" target="_blank">one witness told WBZ</a>. Another said shots rang out in the mall's Bertucci's restaurant.</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	The officer who shot the suspect is a Plymouth County Sheriff's Deputy, <a href="https://twitter.com/LiamWBZ" target="_blank">WBZ reported.</a></p>                            <div class="a-module" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemid="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1462930984_91_Two-dead-among-four-stabbed-by-suspect-fatally-shot-by-off-duty-cop-after-rampage-at-Taunton-Mass-home-and-mall-New-York-Daily-News.jpg"> <figure class="a-image h"><img alt="MANDATORY CREDIT" src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1462930984_91_Two-dead-among-four-stabbed-by-suspect-fatally-shot-by-off-duty-cop-after-rampage-at-Taunton-Mass-home-and-mall-New-York-Daily-News.jpg"/><span class="a-credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">Charles Winokoor/AP</span>     <h2 class="a-caption" itemprop="description">Crime scene tape is seen inside the Macy's at the Silver City Galleria mall in Taunton, Mass., Tuesday.</h2>    <a class="a-enlarge" href="#"/>   </figure></div>         &#13;
<p>&#13;
	The suspect later died, state police said. Taunton and state police are investigating the scenes, all of which are "secured," Taunton cops said.</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	There is "no known nexus to terrorism," police told WBZ, though a motive is unknown.</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	“At this point none of the victims are deceased although some injuries may be life-threatening,” police said. “All were transported to area hospitals.”</p>&#13;
