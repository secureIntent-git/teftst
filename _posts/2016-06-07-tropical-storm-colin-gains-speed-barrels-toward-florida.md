On its forecast path, Colin would churn across southeastern Georgia early on Tuesday and later in the day menace the North and South Carolina coasts.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>As Colin blasted 50 mile-per-hour winds at Florida, tornado warnings were issued across the state. The storm was forecast to dump as much as 8 inches (20 cm) of rain on parts of the state, the hurricane center said.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Florida Governor Rick Scott, who had declared a state of emergency in 34 of the state's 67 counties, said more than 6,000 Florida National Guard members were activated and ready for deployment. Fast-moving squalls, tornados, flooding and property damage resulting from the fierce winds remained threats into the night, and far beyond the storm's immediate path, forecasters warned.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>A statement from Scott's office warned residents to be wary of rip currents and the possibility of 10 foot (3 m) waves along the Gulf Coast.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>"It is critical that all Floridians use caution and remain alert," he said in the statement.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>In the St. Petersburg beach town of Gulfport, roads were already flooded. One resident used a kayak to float down a thoroughfare past a waterfront cafe that stayed open, allowing people used to severe weather to witness the storm.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>"This is a mild tempest," said Trace Taylor, a writer lunching on onion rings. “What’s there to be afraid of? It’s just water and it’s not that bad."</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>More than 10,000 customers were without power ahead of the storm making landfall, utilities reported.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>The storm also threatened crops in Florida, the country's  biggest citrus producer, which sent U.S. orange juice futures on Monday to their highest in more than two years. </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Colin is part of a brisk start to the Atlantic hurricane season that runs through Nov. 30. Over the U.S. Memorial Day holiday weekend, the Carolinas were lashed by heavy rain and winds from Tropical Storm Bonnie.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><span id="midArticle_14"/><p> (Additional reporting by Harriet McLeod in Charleston, South Carolina, Curtis Skinner in San Francisco, Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee; Writing by Jon Herskovitz; Editing by Frances Kerry, David Gregorio and Bill Rigby)</p><span id="midArticle_15"/></div>
