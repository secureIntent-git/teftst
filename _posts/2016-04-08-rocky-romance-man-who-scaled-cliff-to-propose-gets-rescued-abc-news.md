<p itemprop="articleBody">
As marriage proposals go, Michael Banks' was a cliff-hanger.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
Banks, 27, scaled 600-foot Morro Rock just off California's Central Coast early Thursday to propose to his girlfriend, who was watching via cellphone video.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
The good news: Banks' girlfriend said yes, Morro Bay fire Capt. Todd Gailey said.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
The bad news: Banks got stuck on the ledge and had to be plucked by helicopter for a tricky, post-proposal flight to safety.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
Banks "took a different trail down, much steeper" and became stranded, Gailey said. "He couldn't go any direction, on a sheer ledge, with his feet dangling 80 feet off the ground."</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
Rescuers called in a helicopter, and Gailey descended by cable to hoist Banks from the narrow ledge, with the rotors spinning near the cliff and churning air from the blades battering both men.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
Banks was calm for most of the ordeal, but "a little unnerved" at that part, Gailey said. He was not hurt.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
Morro Rock is a landmark just offshore from the community of Morro Bay. Climbing is banned, but some go anyway, and there have been several fatal falls over the years.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
Typically when someone needs to be rescued, they are ticketed, Gailey said. It was not immediately clear if Banks was cited.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
Banks said nothing during the rescue about any second thoughts on his choice of setting for the proposal, Gailey said.</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
However, the fire captain said others should consider a place "where you're not in danger of falling off a cliff."</p>
<p itemprop="articleBody">

<p itemprop="articleBody">
This story has been corrected to show that the air from the helicopter blades posed a problem during the rescue, not ocean spray.</p>
