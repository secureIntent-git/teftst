Demonstrators have repeatedly called for Police Chief Greg Suhr's ouster.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Suhr has said that Woods was a suspect in a stabbing, that he was holding a knife and was a threat to officers who had tried to subdue him with pepper spray and bean bag rounds.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>In video recorded by onlookers, officers could be seen with their weapons pointed at Woods, who was standing with his back against the wall of a building. In the video, Woods does not seem to be holding anything when he is shot multiple times, although police have said they recovered a kitchen knife.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Woods' family filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city in December for wrongful death, describing his killing as a "horrific public execution."</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>The death came amid unrest across the United States over high-profile police killings of black citizens in cities such as Ferguson, Missouri, and Chicago since mid-2014, and a renewed civil rights movement dubbed Black Lives Matter.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><p> (Additional reporting by Curtis Skinner in San Francisco)</p><span id="midArticle_14"/></div>
