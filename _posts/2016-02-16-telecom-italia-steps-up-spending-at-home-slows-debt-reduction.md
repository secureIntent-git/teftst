        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Outlining its new investment plan to 2018, the heavily indebted company said on Tuesday it would spend 12 billion euros ($13.4 billion) over the three years in Italy, including 3.6 billion to lay fiber optic cables. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The development of a national ultra-fast broadband network is one of the top priorities of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's government.

        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>The group said its net debt would fall to below three times EBITDA by the end of 2018, despite the negative impact of accounting adjustments worth 2 billion euros.
