Mrs. Clinton called for a ban on assault weapons like the AR-15 used in Orlando and at the Sandy Hook school shooting in 2012. And she expressed her support for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

Americans out of hatred and bigotry, and an attack on any American is an attack on all Americans,” she said, before directly appealing to gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender voters: “You have millions of allies who will always have your back,” she said. “And I am one of them.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="323" data-total-count="5577">Mrs. Clinton, who had already canceled a planned fund-raiser in Cincinnati and postponed her first joint campaign appearance with <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Barack Obama" class="meta-per">President Obama</a>, told her audience that it was “not a day for politics,” but then, without uttering his name, leveled a stern rebuke at her presumptive Republican opponent, Donald J. Trump.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="246" data-total-count="5823">She invoked the bipartisanship that characterized the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, when she was a senator from New York. “America is strongest when we all believe we have a stake in our country and our future,” she said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="422" data-total-count="6245">Before the Orlando shooting, Mrs. Clinton had planned to deliver a major address previewing her campaign’s general election theme, built around the slogan “Stronger Together.” After learning of the massacre at her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., on Sunday, Mrs. Clinton huddled with advisers, called Orlando’s mayor, Buddy Dyer, and overhauled her remarks. But the theme was still threaded into her critique of Mr. Trump.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="209" data-total-count="6454">“We are not a land of winners and losers,” she said. “This has always been a country of ‘we,’ not ‘me.’ We stand together because we are stronger together — e pluribus unum, out of many one.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="270" data-total-count="6724">Alluding to Mr. Trump’s call for monitoring American-born Muslims and mosques and to his proposal to ban Muslims temporarily from entering the United States, Mrs. Clinton said such actions would harm “the vast majority of Muslims who love freedom and hate terror.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="212" data-total-count="6936">She suggested Mr. Trump’s approach “plays right into the terrorists’ hands,” and alienates Muslim sympathizers in the process, pointing out that “hate crimes against Muslims and mosques have tripled.”</p><a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#whats-next">Continue reading the main story</a>
