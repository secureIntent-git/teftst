<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="6"><p><span class="articleLocation">SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico</span> In the fight against the Zika virus, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls Puerto Rico his top priority and is expressing worry about how to respond.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Unlike the Ebola virus, which has killed more 10,000 people in West Africa since 2014, "there's no playbook for Zika," Dr. Thomas Frieden said in an interview on Tuesday during a tour of the Caribbean island U.S. territory to assess how to proceed.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Most Zika infections cause only minor illness, but the mosquito-borne virus has been linked to a spike in cases of the birth defect microcephaly in Brazil, the country hardest-hit by Zika as it spreads through Latin America and the Caribbean.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Frieden recalled a similar trip to West Africa in 2014 during the Ebola outbreak in which he toured response operations in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>"I met with each of the presidents, and I could tell them, 'If you do this, you can stop Ebola,'" Frieden said.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>With the Zika virus, he said, "I don't have that kind of playbook. We're just now figuring out what are the things that could happen."</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Among U.S. states and territories, Puerto Rico is particularly vulnerable because of its Caribbean location and the presence of the main mosquito species that transmits Zika through bites. The World Health Organization last month declared a global public health emergency over Zika.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Although Zika is not a new virus, the evidence that it may cause microcephaly is recent.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>"Until a few months ago, no one had any idea that Zika could cause birth defects," Frieden told a news conference earlier on Tuesday.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Scientists are urgently trying to confirm whether or not the virus causes microcephaly, a condition in which babies have abnormally small heads, underdeveloped brains and often lifelong developmental problems, amid mounting evidence that it does.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Frieden said it has been 50 years since a new pathogen was discovered that could cause a birth defect and "we've never before known a mosquito-borne disease that could cause a birth defect."</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>ZIKA EMERGENCY FUNDS</p><span id="midArticle_13"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The CDC director spent part of last week testifying before the U.S. Congress to make the case for President Barack Obama's request for more than $1.8 billion in emergency funds for responding to the threat posed by Zika. Several top lawmakers have balked, saying he should first draw from funding previously set aside for fighting Ebola.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>"I'm worried because what I'm seeing here are really big requirements, really big needs, and the funding request is real," Frieden said in the interview, referring to Puerto Rico, home to 3.5 million people.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>"Look at what happened with dengue," a similar virus carried by the same mosquito as Zika, he said. "More than 80 percent of adults were infected," he added.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>Based on that, Frieden said he expects hundreds of thousands of people to be infected in Puerto Rico in the coming months, including thousands of pregnant women.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>"We need to do everything possible to reduce the number," Frieden said.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Frieden expressed concern over the number of Puerto Rican women who do not want to get pregnant but are not using birth control.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"Clearly, if a woman doesn't want to become pregnant and it's consistent with her religion and beliefs to use contraceptives, she should be on contraception," he said. </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>He said it appears that Puerto Ricans are becoming more familiar with the risks associated with Zika.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>"Two weeks ago, we heard that people in Puerto Rico are not worried about this, they are not taking it seriously," Frieden said.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>But Frieden said that "every pregnant women we talk with is taking this very seriously. They are all very worried about Zika. They want help and support to protect themselves."</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><span id="midArticle_8"/><span id="midArticle_9"/><p> (Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Caroline Humer and Will Dunham)</p><span id="midArticle_10"/></div>
