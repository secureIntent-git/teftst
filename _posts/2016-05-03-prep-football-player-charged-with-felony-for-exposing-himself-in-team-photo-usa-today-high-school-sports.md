<p>File this under: High school pranks gone wrong. Terribly wrong.</p>
<p>Red Mountain (Mesa, Ariz.) senior linebacker Hunter Osborn, 19, faces 70 charges for exposing himself in a football team photo that appeared in a program sold to game attendees as well as the school yearbook, <a href="http://www.cbs5az.com/story/31868978/mesa-az-student-arrested-for-indecent-exposure-in-yearbook-picture">according to KPHO-TV</a>.</p>
<p>Osborn exposed a portion of his privates above the waistband of his football pants, the report said. The exposure went unnoticed by authorities during the fall season and appeared in an estimated 3,400 editions of the yearbook before school officials learned of the photo’s graphic nature, according to the television news station.</p>
<p>As far as pranks go, this one went farther than anyone involved probably ever imagined.</p>
<div id="attachment_100665558" style="width: 207px" class="wp-caption alignright" readability="32"><img class="size-full wp-image-100665558" src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Prep-football-player-charged-with-felony-for-exposing-himself-in-team-photo-USA-TODAY-High-School-Sports.jpg" alt="Hunter Osborn (Photo: Mesa Police Department)"/><p class="wp-caption-text">Hunter Osborn (Photo: Mesa Police Department)</p></div>
<p>After confessing to exposing himself on a dare and telling police he was “disgusted” by his own behavior, Osborn was charged with 69 counts of misdemeanor indecent exposure — one for each of the students present at the photo shoot — and one felony count of furnishing harmful items to minors, according to court documents obtained by KPHO-TV.</p>
<p>During what is being termed an ongoing investigation — not that it takes Sherlock Holmes to figure this one out — Mesa Public Schools issued a statement insinuating multiple students were involved (which isn’t much of a leap, considering the two students posing in front of Osborn separated <em>just</em> enough to expose the exposed private parts):</p>
<blockquote readability="11"><p>The district is dismayed by the actions of the students involved in the photograph. Their behavior does not reflect the values of Red Mountain High School or Mesa Public Schools. Upon learning of the photograph, school administration immediately contacted police and is cooperating fully with the investigation. Disciplinary action will follow policy and may be based on the outcome of the police investigation. The school and district are conducting an investigation to determine what actions might have prevented the publication of the photograph, so appropriate safeguards can be put in place going forward. While the small size of the photograph as published makes the details difficult to discern, the yearbook has been recalled so the school can make a minor but critical edit for the inappropriate content.</p></blockquote>
<p>Insert “It’s not the size of the photo …” joke here. Here’s an easy two-step process to prevent future such photos from being published: 1) don’t expose yourself, and 2) if somebody is compelled to expose himself, don’t publish the picture.</p>
<p>If you’re a male who ever spent time in a high school locker room, raise your hand if you know someone who exposed himself inappropriately on a dare or otherwise? Now, raise your hand if you think that person should be in jail for it?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Osborn is home with an ankle bracelet on and could potentially end up on a sex offenders list as a result of a prank gone horribly wrong. Red Mountain sophomore Brooke Bodrero summed up for KPHO-TV how most people probably feel: “It’s something that’s going to be on his record for the rest of his life. The consequences are a little harsh.”</p>
