        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"Based on initial investigation, we believe this is an act of a single person who has frequented the Capitol grounds before. There is no reason to believe this is anything more than a criminal act," Verderosa said. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Police have identified the suspect as Larry Dawson from Tennessee, the Wall Street Journal reported.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Police arrested Dawson, 66, in October after they said he interrupted a House of Representatives session, shouting he was a "Prophet of God," the Washington Post reported.
