"His methods are safe and humane," Klein said by phone.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Millan said in a statement that he was "pleased but not surprised" by the district attorney's decision.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"My team and I are 100 percent dedicated to the proper care of all animals, including the farm pig in this case," Milan said. "I am continuing my work rescuing and rehabilitating even the most difficult problem dogs, which has saved the lives of thousands of animals that otherwise would have been euthanized."</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>A change.org petition signed by more than 13,000 people called Millan's methods inhumane, saying he "used the pig as a bait for the dog all for 'entertainment' purposes." It asked Nat Geo WILD to cancel his show.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Millan, 46, who found fame through his "Dog Whisperer" TV show that has been broadcast worldwide and who has sold millions of books about his training techniques, said he disagreed that he used the pig as bait to provoke the dog. He added that Simon and the pig "became best friends" and the dog was no longer aggressive to toward pigs.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>In a follow-up segment, which was aired later in the episode, Simon is seen co-existing peacefully with a group of pigs, a chicken and other animals.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>The American Humane Society said it received complaints about the episode, and called the incident "abuse" in a statement.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Nat Geo WILD, a unit of 21st Century Fox [NWSNA.UL], rallied around Millan and said that a clip from the episode that was shared online "caused some concern for viewers who did not see or understand the full context of the encounter."    </p><span id="midArticle_11"/><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><p> (Reporting by Sara Catania; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Alan Crosby)</p><span id="midArticle_14"/></div>
