<span class="focusParagraph" readability="3"><p><span class="articleLocation">SAN FRANCISCO</span> Alphabet Inc's (<span id="symbol_GOOGL.O_0">GOOGL.O</span>) self-driving project is advertising dozens of jobs on its website with a special focus on manufacturing expertise.</p></span><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>Thirty-six jobs related to the Google X car project were listed including engineers working on motion control, displays, robotics and sensors as well as managers charged with operations, materials and marketing.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Google, which declined to comment, has denied in the past that it had any interest in making cars. Many industry experts believe the tech giant will partner with an established carmaker, supplying the software that will pioneer the fully autonomous vehicle.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>But the jobs listed provide a window into how much hardware Google may build to contribute to the cars of the future. Developing self-driving cars has been a key priority of traditional carmakers, technology companies like Apple Inc (<span id="symbol_AAPL.O_1">AAPL.O</span>), Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] and auto suppliers.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>A manufacturing process engineer job listing says the post is responsible for "designing factory assembly stations, optimizing production floor layout, automating critical manufacturing processes and approving fixture designs used in the assembly of electronic modules for the self-driving car."</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>A manufacturing supplier quality engineer will create and approve "manufacturing inspection processes, equipment, tools gauges and fixtures for raw material, mechanical components and mechanical assemblies." </p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>A mechanical global supply chain manager, meanwhile, is responsible for manufacturing development execution, among other tasks.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>In January, president of the Google self-driving car project, John Krafcik, said he wanted to form partnerships with established carmakers and suppliers in 2016 to accelerate work.  </p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>When he was hired in September, Krafcik's prior experience at Hyundai and Ford fuelled speculation that Google planned to build its own cars.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Google posted other jobs outside of manufacturing that provided clues as to the scope of the growing project.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>A marketing manager position posted nine days ago requires someone to "shape go-to-market strategy and storytelling to win hearts and minds of community members, influencers and governments."</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>The company is even searching for a head of real estate and workplace services, suggesting that hiring may continue to rise.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Google currently tests its prototype cars in its home base of Mountain View, California and Austin, Texas. It announced last week it would expand testing to Kirkland, Washington later in February.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><p> (Reporting By Alexandria Sage, David Shepardson and Deborah Todd.
