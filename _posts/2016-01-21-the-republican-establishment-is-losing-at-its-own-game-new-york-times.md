            </figcaption></figure><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="314" data-total-count="1333" itemprop="articleBody">What’s even more remarkable is that the party’s weakness comes when it would seem to have tremendous incentives to coalesce behind a single mainstream option. Rarely, if ever, has a party faced such a credible threat from true outsiders, and yet the Republican establishment is both split and on the sidelines.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="260" data-total-count="1593" itemprop="articleBody">It’s a challenge not just for the mainstream of the party, which is in serious danger of losing the party’s most coveted prize to a candidate it dislikes (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/donald-trump-on-the-issues.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Donald J. Trump." class="meta-per">Donald Trump</a> or Mr. Cruz), but also for analysts trying to make sense of an unusual nomination fight.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="213" data-total-count="1806" itemprop="articleBody">How much is the outsiders’ strength a reflection of the weakness of the establishment, the strength of a unique candidate like Mr. Trump or an unusually angry Republican electorate? That can be hard to untangle.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="186" data-total-count="1992" itemprop="articleBody">Traditionally, party-backed candidates have a big advantage in fund-raising, in part because of the longstanding alliance between the party’s big donors and its mainstream politicians.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="290" data-total-count="2282" itemprop="articleBody">Yet Mr. Cruz is tied or ahead of his establishment rivals in this category. The tallies for the likes of Marco Rubio or Jeb Bush and Chris Christie were abysmal in the third quarter — and none raced to announce their tallies in the fourth (the deadline for the fourth quarter is Jan. 31).</p><div id="Moses" class="ad moses-ad nocontent robots-nocontent">

</div><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="435" data-total-count="2717" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-4">Unlike Bernie Sanders on the Democratic side, Mr. Cruz is succeeding in no small part because of his strength among big donors. He has apparently managed to portray himself, at least privately, as the genteel graduate of Princeton and Harvard Law who married someone who became a Goldman Sachs managing director, and not as the full-camouflage hunter whom the Duck Dynasty patriarch calls “one of us” in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i-9D92bzu8">television advertisement</a>.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="349" data-total-count="3066" itemprop="articleBody">The fund-raising success of Mr. Cruz is one of the clearest signs that the divide in the Republican Party runs a lot deeper than “grass-roots” versus “establishment” — it’s within the establishment as well. Mr. Cruz has won more support among conservative elites than one would have guessed based on his oppositional tactics in Congress.</p><div id="MiddleRight1" class="ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

</div><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="430" data-total-count="3496" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-5">Academics have used endorsements from members of Congress and governors as a proxy for elite support, and endorsements usually do a good job of predicting the nominee. But Mr. Cruz may pose an unusual case. Elected officials <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/18/us/politics/ted-cruz-shunned-in-the-senate-plays-unpopularity-to-his-advantage.html">seem to despise him</a>, but the rest of the party’s elite may know him less as a go-it-alone colleague and more as a reliable conservative with the intellectual chops to argue in front of the Supreme Court.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="231" data-total-count="3727" itemprop="articleBody">The rest of the party is divided among four plausible candidates — John Kasich, Mr. Rubio, Mr. Bush and Mr. Christie — upending the tradition of a unified establishment taking on a fractured and uncoordinated conservative base.</p><figure id="first-draft-article-promo" class="interactive interactive-embedded  has-adjacency limit-xsmall layout-flex-medium"><a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-6">Continue reading the main story</a>

</figure><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="501" data-total-count="4228" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-6">The mainstream candidates are fighting viciously, with Mr. Rubio facing negative advertisements from the Bush-aligned <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/campaign_finance/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about Super PACs." class="meta-classifier">super PAC</a> Right to Rise. Mr. Rubio <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/us/politics/group-backing-marco-rubio-unleashes-ads-attacking-chris-christie.html">is attacking</a> Mr. Christie on a wide range of issues. And for all of the fighting between Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump, neither is airing television advertisements against the other. The mainstream candidates have spent few resources to attack either Mr. Cruz or Mr. Trump, sparing them the sort of well-funded attacks that often hurt outsider candidates.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="347" data-total-count="4575" itemprop="articleBody">Even more astonishingly, the mainstream candidates don’t seem to have the backing of the party’s relatively moderate blue-state voters. In recent cycles, these voters have backed candidates like Mitt Romney and John McCain, and they’ve been a big reason that very conservative and evangelical candidates have struggled to win the nomination.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="339" data-total-count="4914" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-7">Yet this year Mr. Trump has the edge. He leads among moderate voters in national surveys. And he has a crucial statewide lead in New Hampshire — a state that would otherwise be a natural place for the mainstream candidates to claim an early victory — in part because four of those candidates are splitting about 40 percent of the vote.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="444" data-total-count="5358" itemprop="articleBody">One possible explanation is news media coverage, which is an overlooked advantage of the party’s establishment. Usually, journalists tend to focus on the establishment-backed candidates who have the best chance of winning. Just ask Ron Paul’s supporters, who relentlessly complained that their candidate wasn’t taken seriously, even as he performed well in early primaries. (The same dynamic is playing out for Bernie Sanders supporters.)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="569" data-total-count="5927" itemprop="articleBody">But Mr. Trump is a true celebrity, and he has dominated media coverage of the race since his entry. It may be part of why establishment-backed candidates are struggling to win over less educated and less ideological voters who often form the backbone of a winning primary coalition. One wonders whether less ideological and less educated voters have tended to prefer establishment candidates because they have agreed on policy and messaging — as one might have guessed — or because establishment-backed candidates have received the preponderance of media attention.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="529" data-total-count="6456" itemprop="articleBody">Despite all of this, the establishment could still squeak out a win. The voters of Iowa or New Hampshire could sift through the mess and clearly elevate one of the establishment-backed candidates, pushing several or all of the others out of the race. This appears to be what party leaders are counting on, and, historically, it’s not a terrible strategy. Party leaders and donors could quickly coalesce behind such a candidate, bestowing a wave of media attention and money ahead of the South Carolina primary or Super Tuesday.</p><div id="MiddleRight2" class="ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

</div><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="570" data-total-count="7026" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-8">This strategy remains plausible in part because Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz, for all of their strengths, still have limited appeal. Neither has been endorsed by a sitting governor or senator — although Mr. Trump did just receive the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/us/politics/donald-trump-sarah-palin.html?ref=politics">endorsement</a> of Sarah Palin, the party’s 2008 vice-presidential nominee. But the party’s mainstream candidates probably won’t reclaim all of their usual advantages, even if an establishment-backed candidate ultimately wins the nomination. They seem likely, for instance, to remain at a financial disadvantage to Mr. Cruz for some time.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="324" data-total-count="7350" itemprop="articleBody">The weakness of the establishment makes it harder to figure out why this year is so different. Are Republican voters much more upset and angry than they were in 2012? Or would that race have gone similarly if Mr. Romney had been replaced by four strong establishment candidates, never mind if Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz had run?</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="273" data-total-count="7623" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-9">Back in June, Republican voters were telling pollsters that they preferred a candidate with <a href="https://today.yougov.com/news/2015/06/01/republicans-want-experience-well-electability/">experience</a> over someone who supported a new direction. They preferred electability over ideological purity. They said they were <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2015/05/20/poll_satisfaction_with_gop_field_up_from_08_12_126659.html">satisfied</a> with their field of traditional candidates.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="334" data-total-count="7957" itemprop="articleBody">Today Republicans want an outsider. The mainstream candidates they liked in June are struggling to amass more than a fraction of the Republican vote. Some, like Scott Walker, have left the race. Did Republicans get angrier? Or did voters shift along with the balance of information, as mainstream voices were drowned out by Mr. Trump?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="238" data-total-count="8195" itemprop="articleBody">The answer matters. It could determine whether the mainstream candidates will make a comeback if they unify, or whether voters are so fed up that Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz can still prevail with ease, even after their current advantages fade.</p>
