Last week, it obtained a court order from a California magistrate asking Apple to comply.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Apple has said the request amounts to asking a company to hack its own device and would set a troubling precedent for how companies must comply with law enforcement.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the congressional panel, also warned that "I don't see a limiting principle" in the Apple case.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>"While the result may only affect this phone, the precedent may be there for many others," Schiff, who represents California, said.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Apple CEO Tim Cook told ABC News on Wednesday the company is willing to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>

        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>The U.S. Justice Department contends it is asking only for Apple to disable "non-encrypted barriers" on the San Bernardino phone, such as a feature that deletes data after ten consecutive incorrect passcode guesses.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>While both Apple and the FBI have said they would like Congress to help resolve the dispute over encryption, legislative proposals have failed to gain momentum. </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>The encryption debate "is the hardest question Iâ€™ve seen in government," Comey said.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><span id="midArticle_14"/><p> (Reporting by Dustin Volz; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Nick Zieminski)</p><span id="midArticle_15"/></div>
