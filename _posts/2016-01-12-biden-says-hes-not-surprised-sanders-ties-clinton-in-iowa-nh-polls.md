<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="6"><p><span class="articleLocation">WASHINGTON</span> U.S. Vice President Joe Biden praised Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders for tapping into Americans’ concerns about growing income inequality, potentially giving the Vermont senator a boost weeks before the Iowa caucuses in which he is drawing close to front-runner Hillary Clinton.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Sanders has argued that he is a more authentic choice to be the party's nominee as he tries to undermine Clinton's double-digit lead in national polls by gaining ground in the important early nominating states of Iowa and New Hampshire.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>In an interview with CNN on Monday night, Biden said the focus by Sanders on the growing gap between the very rich and other Americans had struck a chord with voters.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"Bernie is speaking to a yearning that is deep and real and he has credibility on it," Biden said. "And that is the absolute enormous concentration of wealth in a small group of people with the new class now being able to be shown being left out."</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>He said Clinton, who is campaigning in Iowa on Tuesday, had not focused on income inequality as long.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>"It's relatively new for Hillary to talk about that," Biden said. "Hillary's focus has been other things up to now and that's been Bernie's. No one questions Bernie's authenticity on those issues."</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>On Tuesday, Biden told NBC's "Today" show that he was not trying to criticize Clinton, a former secretary of state, and that her focus had been on foreign policy, while income inequality had been Sanders' "mantra."</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>"Even when income inequality wasn’t as serious as it is today, it was his drumbeat,” Biden said. “She’s coming up with some very good ideas but Bernie is pushing the envelope on this.”</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>The Biden interviews came ahead of President Barack Obama's final State of the Union address on Tuesday night.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>While she has a large national lead in the polls, Clinton has struggled to make solid gains in the early nominating states, which hold outsized influence on the election process. </p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>An NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll from the beginning of January found Clinton leading Sanders by only 3 percentage points in Iowa, although her lead in national polls is wider.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Biden was heavily courted by some Democrats to seek the presidential nomination but declined, citing family obligations after his son Beau Biden died of cancer last year. Within the party, concerns remain whether Clinton can overcome questions surrounding her use of personal email while secretary of state and a lack of enthusiasm among voters.    </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Biden also told CNN that he and Obama want to influence the presidential nominees in November's White House election, especially on gun control.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Clinton has increasingly criticized Sanders for past votes that were viewed favorably by the National Rifle Association.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Biden, when asked, said Sanders is making improvements to his position on gun control. </p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>"What Bernie Sanders has to do is say that the Second Amendment says - which he has, of late - the Second Amendment says you can limit who can own a gun, that people who are criminals shouldn't have guns," Biden said. "People who are schizophrenic and have mental illnesses shouldn't own guns, and he has said that."</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>For more on the 2016 presidential race, see the Reuters blog, “Tales from the Trail” (<a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/talesfromthetrail/">here</a>)  </p><span id="midArticle_1"/><span id="midArticle_2"/><p> (Additional reporting by Megan Cassella; Writing by Doina Chiacu; Editing by <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=chizu.nomiyama&amp;">Chizu Nomiyama</a>, Lisa Von Ahn and <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=bill.trott&amp;">Bill Trott</a>)</p><span id="midArticle_3"/></div>
