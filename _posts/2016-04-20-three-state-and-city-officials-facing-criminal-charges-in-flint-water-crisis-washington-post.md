Here are the people who've played a key role in the crisis. (Claritza Jimenez/The Washington Post)</span> </p> </div> <p>Criminal charges were filed Wednesday against three officials in Michigan as part of a months-long probe into the tainted water crisis in Flint. These charges are the first to stem from the catastrophe — which potentially exposed nearly 100,000 residents to water tainted with lead — and could mark the beginning of a broadening investigation.</p> <p>The felony and misdemeanor charges were approved Wednesday morning by Genesee County District Court Judge Tracy L. Collier-Nix, and are expected to be formally announced later in the afternoon by Michigan attorney general Bill Schuette.</p> <p>Flint employee Michael Glasgow is facing charges of tampering with evidence after allegedly altering water testing results to show artificially low levels of lead in the city’s water, according to media reports. He also faces a charge of willful neglect of office, court records show.</p> <p>Two Michigan Department of Environmental Quality employees, Steven Busch and Michael Prysby, also were criminally charged on Wednesday with misconduct in office and conspiracy to tamper with evidence, as well as violations of the Michigan Safe Drinking Water Act and the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, court records show.</p> <p>None of the three men has been arraigned, and they were not in court Wednesday morning when warrants were issued, <a href="http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/04/charges_filed_in_flint_water_c.html">the Flint Journal reported</a>.</p> <div class="inline-content inline-video" readability="33">  <p> <span class="pb-caption">Michigan's attorney general is expected to announce the first criminal charges connected to dangerous levels of lead in Flint's drinking water. (Reuters)</span> </p> </div> <p>The charges come barely three months after Schuette announced that he would investigate the circumstances that lead to Flint’s lead-tainted water and see if state laws were broken during what he called “a human tragedy.” Schuette’s office said he plans to make “a significant announcement” Wednesday afternoon in Flint alongside Genessee County prosecutor David S. Leyton.</p> <p channel="wp.com" class="interstitial-link"> <i> [<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/flints-water-crisis-reveals-government-failures-at-every-level/2016/01/23/03705f0c-c11e-11e5-bcda-62a36b394160_story.html">Flint’s water crisis reveals government failures at every level</a>] </i> </p> <p>The debacle in Flint began to unfold two years ago. For decades, the once-thriving industrial city bought its water from Detroit. It was piped from Lake Huron, with anti-corrosion chemicals added along the way.</p> <p>But in early 2014, with the city under the control of an emergency manager appointed by Gov. Rick Snyder (R), officials switched to Flint River water as part of a money-saving measure. But the state’s environmental quality agency failed to ensure that corrosion-control additives were part of the new water supply.</p> <div class="inline-content inline-photo-right" style="width:354px;"> <a name="a179d85997"/> <img alt="" src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Three-state-and-city-officials-facing-criminal-charges-in-Flint-water-crisis-Washington-Post.jpg"/><span class="pb-caption">Demonstrators protest the contaminated water crisis in Flint, Mich., outside the Democratic presidential debate held last month in the city. (Rebecca Cook/Reuters)</span> </div> <p>Flint’s water was contaminated with toxic lead soon after the city switched to the Flint River as its source in April 2014 and a Michigan state department failed to ensure that anti-corrosive chemicals were added to the supply. That allowed lead rust, iron and, most dangerous, lead to leach from aging pipes into the city’s tap water. Most residents are still living on bottled water, even after the city switched back to its previous water source last fall.</p> <p>In addition to testing local children for lead poisoning, officials also investigating possible links between the tainted water and a dozen deaths from Legionnaires’ disease.</p> <p channel="wp.com" class="interstitial-link"> <i> [<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/flint/">Tainted water, little hope</a>] </i> </p> <p>A task force appointed by Snyder to investigate the water-contamination crisis in Flint issued a <a href="http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/michigan/files/201603/taskforce_report.pdf?_ga=1.147700144.609033213.1458749402">report last month </a>that largely blamed state officials in what it called “a story of government failure, intransigence, unpreparedness, delay, inaction and environmental injustice.” It detailed a widespread lack of responsibility and leadership behind the catastrophe, which exposed more than 95,000 residents in the beleaguered city — including about 9,000 children under age 6 — to water tainted with lead.</p> <p id="U1040143845105brD">The task force faulted a wide range of officials in its report. It said the state Department of Environmental Quality “failed in its fundamental responsibility” to enforce drinking-water regulations and assured the governor’s office that Flint’s water was safe when it wasn’t.</p> <p>It also said Snyder and his administration failed to act even after “suggestions to do so by senior staff members in the Governor’s office.” In addition, the task force said the Flint Water Department “rushed unprepared” into switching to a new water source in spring 2014 without proper use of corrosion controls. It blamed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s delayed enforcement of federal drinking-water standards for “prolonging the calamity.”</p> <p>Flint’s water system is in much better shape six months after the city switched its water source and began adding chemicals to control corrosion of aging pipes, researchers from Virginia Tech University reported last week. “The system is definitely on its path to recovery,” Marc Edwards, the Virginia Tech professor whose work helped bring Flint’s water crisis to light, said at the time.</p> <p>During a round of tests last month, a lower percentage of homes showed high lead levels, and even in those where levels still exceed federal standards, the amount of lead appears to be falling, the researchers said.</p> <p>The corrosion control efforts also appear to be reducing levels of iron in the water. But the researchers found that too many homes still had lead levels above the federal “action level” of 15 parts per billion. In addition, they said, lead levels throughout Flint’s water system are “highly variable.”</p> <p>“Thus, virtually all homes in Flint must be considered at risk, at the present time, for elevated lead in water,” <a href="http://flintwaterstudy.org/2016/04/results-of-flint-resident-water-lead-sampling-march-2016/" target="_blank">researchers wrote in a summary of their findings</a>, “unless the homeowner is certain that there is no lead plumbing . . . in the home.”</p> <p><em>This story has been updated.</em></p> <p><strong>Read more:</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/flint-water-improving-but-still-unsafe-to-drink-researchers-say/2016/04/12/aad82910-002e-11e6-b823-707c79ce3504_story.html">Water in Flint is improving but still unsafe to drink, researchers say</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/scathing-independent-report-blames-state-officials-for-flint-water-crisis/2016/03/23/82692d52-f12f-11e5-a61f-e9c95c06edca_story.html">Scathing independent report blames state officials for Flint water crisis</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/five-myths-about-lead-in-water/2016/02/26/a3279d26-d686-11e5-9823-02b905009f99_story.html">Five myths about lead in water</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/01/26/why-it-will-be-very-difficult-for-flint-residents-to-sue-the-state-of-michigan-for-money/?postshare=1731461168389870&amp;tid=ss_tw">Criminal charges were just filed in Flint.
