"We have no reason to believe at this point that this was a suicide. The rest is under investigation."</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The influential star, born Prince Rogers Nelson, was found unresponsive in an elevator at the Paisley Park Studios complex where he lived in the suburb of Chanhassen, authorities said.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Olson declined to say whether any items were recovered from the home by police, citing the ongoing investigation. He did say that no one else was found at the property.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The local medical examiner's office conducted a post-mortem examination on Friday morning for four hours but its results could be some time coming. Prince's body was released to his family on Friday afternoon, the Midwest Medical Examiner's Office added in a statement.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>"As part of a complete exam, relevant information regarding Mr. Nelson's medical and social history will be gathered. Anything which could be relevant to the investigation will be taken into consideration," the statement said.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>No information will be released until all results have been obtained, it added.

        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Prince's music blended styles including rock, jazz, funk, disco and R&amp;B, and it won him seven Grammy Awards as well as an Oscar. He had been on a U.S. tour as recently as last week.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>But he was briefly hospitalized a week ago after his plane made an emergency landing in Moline, Illinois, suffering from what his representative told celebrity news website TMZ was flu.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Nevertheless, the star hosted a party at Paisley Park last Saturday night at which one attendee said Prince played two tunes on a piano and then introduced fans to his doctor.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>'REMARKABLE LOSS'</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Prince first found fame in the late 1970s before becoming one of the most inventive forces in American pop music.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>On a trip to London, U.S. President Barack Obama said he listened to "Purple Rain" and "Delirious" on Friday morning at the U.S. ambassador's residence to get "warmed up" for his meetings.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>"I loved Prince ... It's a remarkable loss," Obama told a news conference.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>As well as singing and songwriting, Prince played multiple instruments including guitar, keyboards and drums.

        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Record producer L.A. Reid told NBC's "Today" show on Friday that he was perplexed by the death of his friend.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"The Prince I know was super-healthy, vegan, wasn't an abuser of drugs, wasn't an abuser of alcohol," Reid said. "He was clean and he looked young and he looked really healthy and vibrant, so the whole thing is really mysterious to me."</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>During his life, Prince was known as fiercely determined to protect his intellectual property. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>How others might profit from his legacy hinges on how astute he was about arranging for control of his music after death. Twice divorced with no surviving children, he apparently lacked any immediately identifiable heirs.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Ex-wife Manuela Testolini said that as well as being a husband and friend, Prince had been a "fierce philanthropist" who encouraged her to set up her own charity. She had contacted him only a few days ago, she added, to tell him she was building a school in his honor.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>"I am heartbroken beyond words," Testolini said in a statement on Friday. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/><span id="midArticle_9"/><p> (Additional reporting by Jane Ross in Minneapolis, Alex Dobuzinskis, Dan Whitcomb and Steve Gorman in Los Angeles, and Suzannah Gonzales in Chicago; Writing by Daniel Wallis; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)</p><span id="midArticle_10"/></div>
