					<p>Oscars host Chris Rock gave his daughters a boost with their Girl Scout Cookie sales by dispatching a team of Los Angeles-area Girl Scouts through the Dolby Theatre selling cookies to the gathered glitterati.</p> 
<p>An unfair advantage bestowed by a famous father? Sure, but you'd do the same for your kid if you could.</p> 
<p>And Rock the troop weren't just selling cookies for laughs inside the Dolby Theatre at the 88th annual Academy Awards.</p> 
<p>After appearing during the Oscar broadcast, the girls came back during commercial breaks to hawk more treats to hungry celebs.</p> 
<p>They quickly found customers in Steven Spielberg and Benicio del Toro. Christian Bale picked up a box, too, after asking his wife to loan him the cash.</p>
 
<p>As soon as Henry Cavill scored his box of Thin Mints the "Man of Steel" star ripped it open and dug in.</p><p>Hey, even Superman gets hungry during a long awards show.</p> 
<p>And those enterprising girls collected a quick $65,243.00 for a good cause.</p> 
<p><i>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</i></p></div>
