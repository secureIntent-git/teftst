      --> <p>Belgium’s transport minister resigned on Friday amid allegations that she ignored warnings over shortcomings in security monitoring and funding at Brussels Airport, becoming the first member of the government to fall in the wake of <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/belgian-authorities-arrest-suspected-third-brussels-airport-attacks-officials-say-1460129257" class="icon none">last months terror attacks</a>.</p> <p>A spokesman for Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel confirmed that he had accepted the resignation of Jacqueline Galant, a member of his own centrist party.</p> <p>Pressure on Ms. Galant had grown in recent days after leaked European Commission reports showed that the European Union executive had repeatedly warned that the country’s civil aviation authority wasn’t conducting sufficient checks at Belgian airports.</p> <p>The commission is in charge of ensuring that airports, airlines and national regulators implement EU laws on aviation security. Those laws, and the commission checks, are limited to the “airside” of an airport—after passengers have passed through security—rather than the “landside,” which includes the airport departure hall where the terrorists set off their bombs on March 22. </p> <p>The commission’s reports also raised concerns over shortcomings at the civil aviation authority, which is controlled by the transport ministry. </p> <p>Those concerns were underscored by the resignation earlier this week of the senior civil servant in Ms. Galant’s ministry, Laurent Ledoux. In comments to Belgian media, Mr. Ledoux harshly criticized Ms. Galant’s working methods and claimed that she ignored calls for extra funding for security monitoring at the airport.</p> <p>At a hearing in the Belgian Parliament on Thursday, Ms. Galant was also criticized by lawmakers for her failure to prevent a walkout by air-traffic controllers. That walkout, triggered by a pension dispute, led to severe disruptions at Brussels Airport on Tuesday and Wednesday, just over a week after the hub reopened.</p> <p>The March 22 bombings killed 16 people at the airport and another 16 at the Maelbeek subway stop. More than 300 were injured. </p> <p>Two other members of the government, Interior Minister Jan Jambon and Justice Minister Koen Geens, had offered to resign in the days after the attacks. But their offers were rejected by Mr. Michel.</p> <p> <strong>Write to </strong>Matthias Verbergt at <a href="mailto:Matthias.Verbergt@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">Matthias.Verbergt@wsj.com</a> and Gabriele Steinhauser at <a href="mailto:gabriele.steinhauser@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">gabriele.steinhauser@wsj.com</a> </p>
