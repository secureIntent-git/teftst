If they are not neutered, you run the risk of them breaking into the herd, hurting someone," she said.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Becoming a steer seems to be a better fate than the alternative the bull faced when he broke free on his way into a Queens slaughterhouse on Friday morning and fled. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>The bull rampaged through the nearby campus of York College, where New York City police armed with tranquilizer guns shot him with two darts and brought him to the ground, said Officer Sophia Mason, an NYPD spokeswoman.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The bull was transported to Animal Care and Control in Brooklyn, which contacted Farm Sanctuary, which in turn reached out to Tracey McShane and her husband, the former host of "The Daily Show" on Comedy Central. The Stewarts nicknamed the bull "Frank Lee" for Frank Lee Morris, who escaped Alcatraz prison in 1962.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Stewart drove his livestock trailer to Brooklyn and, after hand-feeding hay to the distraught bull to calm him, drove the animal to New Jersey to be loaded onto another trailer and driven to upstate New York.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>The bull was being examined on Saturday at a Cornell University veterinary hospital to be sure he was healthy enough to undergo the procedure that will allow him to live out his days with the other steers in Watkins Glen.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>"This guy is going to have a perfect life. He'll be running with friends and head-butting with the boys," Coston said. </p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>The bull is the second bovine since January to escape a New York City butchery - along with a goat - and to win its freedom, the NYPD said.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><span id="midArticle_12"/><p> (Reporting by Barbara Goldberg; Editing by Scott Malone and Dan Grebler)</p><span id="midArticle_13"/></div>
