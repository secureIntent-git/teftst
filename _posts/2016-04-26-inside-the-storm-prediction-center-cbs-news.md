        <p><strong>NORMAN, Okla. -- </strong>The heart of America is bracing for what could be more rough weather this week -- conditions are ripe for some destructive storms.   CBS News went to Norman, Oklahoma to find out how experts track them.</p><p>The storms already started in parts of Kansas already on Sunday. Bill Bunting, the operations chief at the Storm Prediction Center, said that is only the beginning.</p><figure class="image pull-left image-large "><span class="img "><img src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Inside-the-Storm-Prediction-Center-CBS-News.png" alt="bojorquezen0425.png" height="350" width="620"/></span><figcaption readability="1.5"><div class="caption" readability="8"><p>A meteorologist at the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma points out a storm system</p></div><p>

"Tornadoes, damaging winds, and large hail."</p><p>According to Bunting, the Midwest, South and Central Plains should brace for a week of potentially dangerous weather.    The forecast comes from the center's "war room," where meteorologists track the systems and make predictions.</p><p>Bunting explained what he has learned over the years about the science of predicting weather and making forecasts.</p><p>"I think key has been the understanding of how storms develop, and what environments are most favorable for say, tornadic thunderstorms, versus those that don't produce tornadoes."</p><p>  It starts with a strong jet stream from the Northwest colliding with a surge of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, but scientists have discovered another clue: shifts in winds below the jet stream ahead of a storm can help predict severe weather. </p><figure class="image pull-left image-large "><span class="img "><img src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/1461629944_555_Inside-the-Storm-Prediction-Center-CBS-News.png" alt="bojorquezstorms.png" height="350" width="620"/></span><figcaption><p>

Instead of a simple "take shelter," people may hear "mobile homes will be destroyed" and "flying debris will be deadly."</p>
