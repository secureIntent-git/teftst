            Live Updates: Winter Storm        </h2>
                <p class="interactive-leadin">
            More than 10 states on the Eastern Seaboard declared states of emergency.        </p>

</figure><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="435" data-total-count="1623" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-4">The city’s snowfall was still less than that of parts of Maryland and West Virginia, where in some parts 40 inches had fallen. The storm which caused more than 10 states on the Eastern Seaboard to declare states of emergency, killed 18 on Saturday, according to The Associated Press. Several of the people, including a 94-year-old man in Smithtown on Long Island, appeared to have died while clearing snow, according to news reports.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="533" data-total-count="2156" itemprop="articleBody">On Manhattan streets after the snow stopped falling, couples strolled down the middle of Avenue of the Americas in the West Village on Saturday night. Times Square seemed sleepy; all Broadway shows had been canceled on Saturday, according to the Broadway League. In Herald Square, people made snow angels in the middle of 34th Street and uploaded them to social media. Yet even with the snowfall over, it seemed few were budging from being indoors – a stream of deliverymen skidded their bikes through the night in wheel-high snow.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="217" data-total-count="2373" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-5">The great dig-out began early on Sunday morning under a bright, almost-full moon the usual rumble of traffic was replaced with a silence punctuated in places with the scraping sounds of a few people with snow shovels.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="434" data-total-count="2807" itemprop="articleBody">In Williamsburg, Brooklyn, an hour before sunrise, Remer Lemus, 35, shoveled out the first of seven apartment building walkways he had to clear. He said he would spend half his day excavating as much snow as he could, and then the second half returning to do “detail” snow work, like around the edges of stairwells and sidewalks. “We haven’t seen snow this season and we got this storm,” he said. “It’s a lot of snow.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="608" data-total-count="3415" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-6">Passers-by walked in the street, cleared in points by snowplows down to bare blacktop, rather than try the thickly covered sidewalk. Despite the ban on non-emergency or sanitation traffic until 7 a.m. Sunday, Albert Cepeda, 37, drove a gray delivery van at 5:30 a.m. along Bedford Avenue that was filled with fresh bread from the bakery for which he works. “We have to work,” he said. “If our bakery doesn’t work we have a problem.” He added that the main streets were easy enough to drive down, but on secondary streets the drifts made for white-knuckled driving. “It’s impossible,” he said.</p> <figure id="east-coast-snow-storm" class="interactive promo  has-adjacency layout-small"><a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-7">Continue reading the main story</a>

</div><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="347" data-total-count="3762" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-7">The storm — blustery in some places, blinding in others — was a swirling, sprawling mass with a reach of nearly 1,000 miles. It flooded low-lying beaches and brought down trees and power lines, leaving thousands without electricity. The storm also glazed roads and varnished trees as it pummeled the Mid-Atlantic region with destructive force.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="339" data-total-count="4101" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-8">The ocean poured into shore towns in southern New Jersey: In Sea Isle City, floodwaters laden with chunks of ice surged down the streets, and in Wildwood the frigid, brackish water submerged cars halfway up to their windows. In Belmar, the wind drove a sailboat out of its marina and tangled its mast in overhead wires, knocking out power.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="234" data-total-count="4335" itemprop="articleBody">One of the 18 people who died in the storm, was a good Samaritan who was shot on the side of a North Carolina highway when he stopped to help a stranded motorist who became belligerent, according to a <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/crime/article56234845.html">report</a> in The Charlotte Observer.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="744" data-total-count="5079" itemprop="articleBody">But most of the storm’s victims died while attempting to drive on icy highways or shovel snow in the punishing winds. By 4 a.m., the New York Police Department had responded to 401 accidents and towed 367 vehicles, a spokesman said. Three of those who died while shoveling were New Yorkers — men aged 67, 78 and 80 — in Queens and Staten Island, the authorities said. Two more were on Long Island, a 61-year-old man in West Hempstead and a 94-year-old man in Smithtown whose body was found next to a snow blower, the authorities said. A sixth shoveling death occurred in Maryland, where a 60-year-old man died of a heart attack on Saturday, a spokesman for the Prince George’s County Fire and Emergency Medical Services Department said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="779" data-total-count="5858" itemprop="articleBody">The storm <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/live/winter-storm-jonas/unexpected-diversions-to-florida">prevented the scheduled return</a> of Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who had been in Istanbul for meetings with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and other officials. The vice president had planned to fly home to Washington on Saturday, but White House officials said that Air Force Two would be rerouted to Miami instead and that Mr. Biden would go on to Washington once the weather cleared. The storm also caused Gov. Chris Christie <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/live/winter-storm-jonas/chris-christie-discusses-his-trip-home">to go back to New Jersey</a>, far from Republican voters in New Hampshire, where he had taken his presidential campaign. Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, on his way home from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, was also diverted, in his case to MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla., where he checked in to a hotel.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="413" data-total-count="6271" itemprop="articleBody">The storm stranded airline passengers up and down the East Coast, with 4,993 flights canceled on Saturday and 2,169 canceled for Sunday, according to <a target="_" href="http://Flightaware.com">Flightaware.com</a>, a website that tracks such things. At La Guardia Airport, there were no lines at security checkpoints and no baggage carousels rumbling: With virtually no flights coming in, there was no baggage to unload and there were no passengers to claim it.</p>
