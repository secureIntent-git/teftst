She had sought to be reinstated as his designated healthcare agent, but a Los Angeles judge dismissed that case in May.

She had previously denied allegations that she was manipulating her father. "Shari has made it abundantly clear that she has no desire to manage Viacom nor chair its board," she said in a statement on Tuesday.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>

        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>NAI controls 80 percent of the voting shares in Viacom and CBS Corp.
