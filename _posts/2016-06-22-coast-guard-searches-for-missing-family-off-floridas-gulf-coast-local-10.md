 <p><strong>ENGLEWOOD, Fla.</strong> - The U.S. Coast Guard is searching for a father and his three teenage children who vanished off Florida's Gulf coast on Sunday.</p><p>Ace Kimberly, 45, and his children, Roger, 13, Donny, 15, and Rebecca, 17, left Sarasota about 7 a.m. Sunday en route to Fort Myers to repair their sailboat.</p><p>The father called his brother, who lives in Fort Myers about 3 p.m. the same day to say that he and his children were in 6-foot seas near Englewood. The family has not been heard from since. </p><p>The Coast Guard received a report from a concerned family member Tuesday and began its search.</p><p>"We later found out that he had talked to his brother Sunday afternoon and that his brother said he was experiencing rough seas and thunderstorms, and he was worried and wanted his brother to send him some weather reports, and that's the last he heard of him," Capt. Gregory Case of the U.S. Coast Guard said Wednesday at a news conference.</p><p>Case said Kimberly is divorced from his children's mother, who lives out of state. She is on her way down to Florida in hopes that authorities are able to find her children.</p><p>"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family," Case said. "I know this is a super difficult time for them, and we are doing everything we can and throwing everything we have in the search for them."</p><p>Numerous state and local maritime emergency responders are also assisting in the search.</p><p>Search crews are asking mariners to keep a sharp lookout and contact the Coast Guard with any information regarding the whereabouts of the missing family. </p><p>According to Case, an aircraft spotted some items in the water about 33 nautical miles off Sanibel Island that they believe are from the family's sailboat.</p><p>The items include four water bottles that were tied together, one or two tennis shoes, a basketball, a propane tank and six life jackets.</p><p>Case said authorities got in contact with a boater who was nearby, who went to retrieve the items.</p><p>"They went over and took possession of those items, and then our station boat is headed out there to take possession of those items," Case said.</p><p>Anyone with information about the family's whereabouts is asked to call the Coast Guard Sector St. Petersburg at 727-824-7506.</p>
