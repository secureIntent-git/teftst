<span class="focusParagraph" readability="6"><p><span class="articleLocation">TOKYO</span> Sony Corp (<span id="symbol_6758.T_0">6758.T</span>), widely regarded as a key supplier of image sensors for Apple Inc's (<span id="symbol_AAPL.O_1">AAPL.O</span>) iPhones, said on Friday it was bracing for a slowdown in the premium smartphone market after sales of its sensors fell in the third quarter.</p></span><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>Videogame sales and cost cuts in Sony's flagging mobile unit pushed October-December operating profit up 11 percent, beating analyst estimates, but the firm confirmed a much-feared hit to a segment that in recent quarters helped it shake off years of losses.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>"Demand for image sensors from a specific customer has slowed since November due to a slowdown in the high-end smartphone market," Chief Financial Officer Kenichiro Yoshida told reporters at a briefing, without naming the client.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Worries about weaker iPhone sales and a slowdown in China's smartphone market - the world's biggest - have weighed on Sony shares in recent weeks. The stock closed up 6.1 percent ahead of earnings, still down around 16 percent since the start of 2016.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Yoshida said Sony was planning its budget for the next year assuming a fall in global demand for high-end smartphones.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Sony also said October-December sales of devices, including image sensors, fell 13 percent from a year earlier. The segment, also hit by weak battery sales, booked a loss of 11.7 billion yen compared with a 53.8 billion yen profit in the year prior.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>In addition to image sensors, Sony has depended on cost cuts and strong sales of PlayStation 4 games to improve its bottom line over the past year.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The two factors helped third-quarter operating profit rise 11 percent from a year earlier to 202.1 billion yen ($1.68 billion), beating the average 175 billion yen forecast of 8 analysts according to Thomson Reuters data.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>In mobile, sales fell 15 percent in a division struggling to compete with Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (<span id="symbol_005930.KS_2">005930.KS</span>), as well as low-cost Asian rivals. But operating income more than doubled to 24 billion yen as Sony cut spending on marketing and development and gave up its pursuit of market share.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>The company maintained its outlook for full-year operating profit to grow to 320 billion yen from 68.5 billion in the previous year.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
