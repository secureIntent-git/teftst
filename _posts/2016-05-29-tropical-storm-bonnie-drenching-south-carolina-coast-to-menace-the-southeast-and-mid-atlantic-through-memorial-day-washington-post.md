(National Hurricane Center)</span> </div> <p><em>(This story, originally published midday Saturday, was updated Saturday night.)</em></p> <p>There’s never a good time for a tropical storm, even a weak one. But most would agree Memorial Day weekend is particularly bad timing, especially those along the South Carolina coast, where a tropical storm warning is in effect ahead of heavy rain, somewhat strong winds, and a possible 1- to 2-foot storm surge.</p> <p>Bonnie, the season’s second named storm, achieved tropical storm status late this afternoon. It is currently centered in the Atlantic Ocean about 135 miles south-southeast of Charleston, S.C. Maximum sustained winds of 40 mph have increased modestly since yesterday. Slight strengthening is possible overnight before gradual weakening on Sunday.</p> <div class="inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-normal"> <a name="724e636b84"/> <img class="unprocessed" data-hi-res-src="https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/files/2016/05/Capture-bon-bon.png&amp;w=1484" data-low-res-src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Tropical-Storm-Bonnie-drenching-South-Carolina-coast-to-menace-the-Southeast-and-Mid-Atlantic-through-Memorial-Day-Washington-Post.png" src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Tropical-Storm-Bonnie-drenching-South-Carolina-coast-to-menace-the-Southeast-and-Mid-Atlantic-through-Memorial-Day-Washington-Post.png"/><br/><span class="pb-caption">Satellite view of Tropical Storm Bonnie Saturday evening.

Sunday morning or afternoon. <a href="http://radar.weather.gov/ridge/Conus/southeast.php">Heavy rains have already begun falling</a> near the coast and moved towards South Carolina’s interior.</p> <p>Because this is a relatively weak tropical storm, rain rather than wind or storm surge is considered the greatest hazard. That said, sustained winds over 30 mph are like along the South Carolina coast tonight, with the National Hurricane Center showing a <a href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/refresh/graphics_at2+shtml/144305.shtml?tswind120#contents">40 to 50 percent chance of tropical storm force winds</a> (sustained at 39 mph or higher).</p> <p>The system’s circulation, along with occasional showers and thunderstorms, may linger for several days along the South Carolina-North Carolina coast, gradually weakening through midweek.</p> <p>The rain is expected to be heaviest in South Carolina overnight, before spreading northward into North Carolina and Virginia Sunday. Generally the storm is forecast to produce 1 to 3 inches of rain near its core, with locally up to 5 inches.</p> <p>Northern Virginia, the District, Maryland and Delaware get in on the rain late Sunday afternoon into Monday, with up to about 1 to 2 inches possible in many spots as tropical moisture surges northward far from the core of the system.</p> <div class="inline-content inline-photo inline-photo-normal"> <a name="96c31cb5c5"/> <img class="unprocessed" data-hi-res-src="https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/files/2016/05/wpc_total_precip_ma_8.png&amp;w=1484" data-low-res-src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1464487809_626_Tropical-Storm-Bonnie-drenching-South-Carolina-coast-to-menace-the-Southeast-and-Mid-Atlantic-through-Memorial-Day-Washington-Post.png" src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1464487809_626_Tropical-Storm-Bonnie-drenching-South-Carolina-coast-to-menace-the-Southeast-and-Mid-Atlantic-through-Memorial-Day-Washington-Post.png"/><br/><span class="pb-caption">Rainfall forecast through 8 p.m. Monday night.
