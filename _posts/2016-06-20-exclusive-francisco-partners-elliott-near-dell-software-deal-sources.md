EMC owns a controlling stake in VMware Inc (<span id="symbol_VMW.N_1">VMW.N</span>), a cloud-based virtualization software company.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Dell is seeking to sell almost all of its software assets, including Quest Software, which helps with information technology management, as well as SonicWall, an e-mail encryption and data security provider, the people said.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Boomi, a smaller asset focusing on cloud-based software integration, will be retained by Dell, one of the people added.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>An agreement between Dell and the consortium of Francisco Partners and Elliott could be reached as early as this week, the people said, cautioning that the negotiations could still end unsuccessfully. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Dell declined to comment, while Francisco Partners and Elliott did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>A sale of Dell's software division would free it from some of its least profitable assets and cap the program of divestitures that the Round Rock, Texas-based computer maker embarked on following its deal with EMC. EMC shareholders are due to vote on the deal with Dell on July 19. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/>

        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>EMC was also a target for Elliott. In 2014, the hedge fund called on the company to spin off its stake in VMware or pursue other merger opportunities. Elliott reached a settlement with EMC last year and subsequently voiced support for the deal with Dell.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Francisco Partners focuses on private equity investments in the technology sector. It has raised about $10 billion in capital and invested in more than 150 technology companies since it was launched more than 15 years ago.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><p> (Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York and Liana B.
