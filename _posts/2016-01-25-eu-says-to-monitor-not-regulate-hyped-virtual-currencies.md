<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="6"><p><span class="articleLocation">LONDON</span> The European Union will monitor rather than regulate "hyped" virtual currencies for now, because too little is known to justify new rules beyond reining in specific risks like money-laundering, the body's executive said on Monday. </p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The world's 600 virtual currencies are tiny, with bitcoin alone accounting for 90 percent of the $7 billion sector, compared with daily turnover of about $5 trillion on global foreign exchange markets.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Virtual currencies are traded online and not backed by a central bank. The collapse of bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox two years ago raised concerns about consumer protection in a largely self-regulated, experimental sector.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>After the attacks in Paris last November, policymakers also want to ensure that virtual currencies are not used to finance terrorism.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The EU's European Commission has powers to propose bloc-wide rules, but one of its senior financial services officials, Olivier Salles, said his focus was on monitoring rather than proposing new rules.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>"It's easy to fail when you regulate, you can be too early and too late. From the European Commission's perspective, we are more on the monitoring side," Salles told a hearing on virtual currencies in the European Parliament.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"We want to understand better what is happening," Salles said.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>The EU executive is examining options to prevent activities like money laundering, but "we are not in a hurry" to regulate financial products linked to virtual currencies, he added.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Sean Ennis, an economist at the OECD club of rich nations, said the EU could learn lessons from how Britain has maintained lower regulatory requirements for peer-to-peer lending, enabling the fledgling sector to innovate and grow much faster than in the rest of Europe.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>"I am very modest about the potential for regulation," Ennis said, echoing the International Monetary Fund's first paper on virtual currencies published last week. </p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>It said regulatory responses should be in line with risks and not stifle innovation.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Policymakers are turning their attention to the technology underlying the currencies, known as blockchain, which has the potential to shake up the payments system.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Jakob von Weizsaecker, a German center member of the European Parliament, said regulators needed to understand blockchain better before it became more commonly used. </p><span id="midArticle_13"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>He is compiling a report on virtual currencies, which the commission will study, and said that precautionary monitoring rather than immediate regulation was probably best.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Bitcoin transactions are dominated by about 20 companies, said Jeremy Millar of technology consultants Magister Advisors.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>"They are putting in regulatory capital, they are already registered with the regulators, by and large. If the companies and the activities are already regulated, I don't know what it means to regulate the technology," Millar said.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>The European Union is due to unveil measures next month to tackle terrorism financing.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><span id="midArticle_2"/><p> (Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=katharine.houreld&amp;">Katharine Houreld</a>)</p><span id="midArticle_3"/></div>
