        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"We're working hard to keep that giant contained so it doesn't wake up," Schwarber said.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>So far, the blaze has destroyed only one building - a water-treatment center at a campground, he said. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>But it has threatened more than 200 structures and forced officials to close the 101 Freeway near the Pacific Coast periodically as flames crept to within less than a mile of the shore.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>More than 1,900 firefighters were assigned to the blaze.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>"Red flag warnings" were also posted for the mountains around Los Angeles on Monday as two fires erupted in the foothills of the Angeles National Forest north of the city.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>One blaze, dubbed the Reservoir Fire, had consumed some 1,500 acres by late afternoon and prompted the evacuation of about 70 homes. The second blaze a few miles away devoured about 1,000 acres, U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Lulu Castillo said.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>About 160 miles farther south, firefighters battled flames roaring through dry brush and chaparral near the Mexican border for a second day, keeping the desert community of Potrero under evacuation. </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>That fire, about 50 miles southeast of San Diego, had charred more than 1,900 acres and was just 5 percent contained on Monday, California fire officials reported.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Two states away, the 6-day-old Dog Head Fire in central New Mexico has charred more than 17,000 acres and was 9 percent contained after destroying 24 homes.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><span id="midArticle_15"/><p> (Additional reporting by Steve Gorman; Editing by Dan Grebler and Paul Tait)</p><span id="midArticle_16"/></div>
