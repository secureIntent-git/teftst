<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocatio&lt;/span&gt;n">The U.S. Transportation Department said on Thursday it may waive some vehicle safety rules to allow more driverless cars to operate on U.S. roads as part of a broader effort to speed up development of self-driving vehicles.</span></p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx unveiled the new policy guidance for self-driving vehicle testing in Detroit. He also announced that U.S. President Barack Obama will call on Congress to approve nearly $4 billion over 10 years to accelerate vehicle automation.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Major automakers and technology companies led by Alphabet Inc's Google are racing to develop and sell vehicles that can drive themselves, but they have complained that state and federal safety rules are impeding testing and ultimate deployment of such vehicles.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"We are bullish on automated vehicles," Foxx said at an event attended by Tesla Inc, Google and major automakers.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which Foxx oversees, told automakers it is willing to exempt up to 2,500 vehicles industry-wide from some auto safety standards for up to two years in a move that could allow Google to get its self-driving cars on U.S. roads.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Safety regulators will write best practices guidelines for self-driving cars within six months, Foxx said.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Major automakers backed the changes, including General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co. "We are committed to working with the government and the rest of the industry on standards," GM said in a statement.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>The agency is also willing to consider requests by automakers for rule interpretations that would boost innovation. NHTSA said it confirmed that a BMW remote self-parking feature meets federal safety standards.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Regulators will set as a condition that companies demonstrate that their autonomous cars can operate safely.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Akshay Anand, analyst at Kelley Blue Book, said "regulations are one of the biggest hurdles to autonomous driving" and praised the government's move, saying it "ensures autonomous vehicles will be a reality in due time."</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Under current rules, Google test cars must have steering wheels and pedals. NHTSA is encouraging automakers to seek exemptions from safety rules if needed to get driverless cars on the road. NHTSA also plans to work with states to develop uniform state regulations on driverless cars. </p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>In December, California proposed state regulations requiring all autonomous cars to have a steering wheel, throttle and brake pedals when operating on California public roads, citing safety concerns. A licensed driver would need to be in the driver's seat. </p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Google criticized the California proposal. </p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Separately, Foxx was expected to join executives from several major automakers on Friday to announce a voluntary agreement aimed at improving industry-government cooperation on safety enforcement, enhancing cybersecurity and improving the use of accident data to identify defective vehicles more quickly.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>NHTSA and automakers will hold further talks on whether a voluntary aviation-government cooperation program could work in the auto industry.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><span id="midArticle_16"/><p> (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Joseph White, <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=bill.rigby&amp;">Bill Rigby</a> and Meredith Mazzilli)</p><span id="midArticle_17"/></div>
