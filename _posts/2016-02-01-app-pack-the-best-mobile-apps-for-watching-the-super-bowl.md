<br><div id="start-of-content"><p>With the biggest television event of the year less than a week away, it’s time to load up your phone with some crucial apps that’ll help you better enjoy the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>The big one for watching the game itself is <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/superbowl/live/player?ttag=SB16_os_lk_nstar_watch">CBS Sports</a>, which will be streaming the Super Bowl for free on Sunday, February 7 at 6:30pm EST. If you’re a cord-cutter, it’s a must. You can either beam the game to your TV via Chromecast or AirPlay, or you can get the CBS Sports app for your Roku box. If you’re a Frisco local, download <a href="http://www.sfbaysuperbowl.com/road-to-50-app#5rCQu4qgTVECHfH4.97">Road to 50</a> and the <a href="http://www.levisstadium.com/stadium-info/stadium-app/">Levi’s Stadium</a> app. And no matter where you are, you can take the hassle out of feeding your couch-guests by downloading <a href="https://postmates.com/">Postmates</a>. Just go heavy on the tip!</p>
