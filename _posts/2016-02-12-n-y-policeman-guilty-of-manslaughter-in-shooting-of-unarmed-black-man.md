<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="3"><p><span class="articleLocation">NEW YORK</span> A New York City police officer was convicted of manslaughter on Thursday for fatally shooting an unarmed black man in a darkened public housing stairwell.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>A jury in Brooklyn found Peter Liang guilty in connection with the death of Akai Gurley, 28, who was killed by a bullet fired from Liang's gun on Nov. 20, 2014, that ricocheted off a wall.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>A stunned Liang buried his head in his hands after the verdict was read in court.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>He faces up to 15 years in prison when he is sentenced in April. The mostly white jury deliberated for more than two days.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The shooting added to nationwide protests in cities like Baltimore and Ferguson, Missouri, over the use of police force against minorities, though Liang, a Chinese-American, was not accused of deliberately killing Gurley.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>The rookie officer was on patrol inside a Brooklyn public housing project with his partner and drew his gun upon entering a pitch-black stairwell.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>He fired a single bullet that glanced off a wall and into the chest of Gurley, who was walking one floor below.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>At trial, Liang, 28, testified that a sudden noise startled him, causing his finger to slip onto the trigger and fire. It was only after descending the stairs, Liang said, that he realized the errant bullet had hit Gurley.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>"Oh my God, someone's hit," a tearful Liang recalled saying upon finding a bleeding Gurley lying on a landing, as his girlfriend frantically tried to revive him.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>But prosecutors argued Liang fired toward the sound deliberately and that he must have known only another person could have caused the noise that surprised him.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>"It was a tragedy, but justice was done," Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson told the television station NY1. He added that the verdict showed Akai Gurley's life mattered, echoing the "Black Lives Matter" movement.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>A defense lawyer for Liang, Robert Brown, said he would appeal and warned that the verdict would put officers in danger.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>"It says to the NYPD, you have to be very cautious about taking your gun out, to the point of risking your own life," he said.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Gurley's family and friends expressed gratitude after the conviction.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>"I'm just glad we got a guilty verdict," said Kimberly Ballinger, his domestic partner and the mother of his young daughter.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>Activists cheered the outcome on social media, with many saying it was an important step in holding officers accountable. Organizers had already called for a demonstration on Friday at police headquarters regardless of the jury's decision.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>Liang's indictment last year came weeks after a grand jury declined to charge a white New York officer in the chokehold death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man, sparking citywide protests.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Thompson said the Liang case had no connection to the ongoing debate over police tactics.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>"This officer was indicted not because of what is happening elsewhere in the country but because of what happened in that stairwell," he said. "This conviction is not a conviction of the entire NYPD."</p><span id="midArticle_3"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>But Patrick Lynch, the president of the city's largest police union, said the verdict "will have a chilling effect on police officers across the city because it criminalizes a tragic accident."</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Liang was also convicted of official misconduct for failing to offer Gurley aid. His lawyers argued he was in shock and felt unqualified to perform CPR due to inadequate training.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>As the trial concluded on Tuesday, prosecutors offered jurors a new and more damning account, claiming for the first time that Liang aimed a shot on purpose toward the sound he heard.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>"I think it's clear to you that he knew someone was there," Assistant District Attorney Joseph Alexis said in his closing argument, adding that the shooting was "no accident."</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Brown, the defense lawyer, said the jury may have been swayed when the prosecution "changed their entire argument."</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Liang's lawyers had portrayed the shooting as a "million-to-one" occurrence. They also emphasized the dangers of so-called "vertical patrols," a point that was underscored when two officers were shot this month when conducting a similar patrol in a Bronx public housing building.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>In a statement, Mayor Bill de Blasio said he hoped the verdict would bring some closure to Gurley's family.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><span id="midArticle_11"/><p> (Reporting by Joseph Ax; Editing by <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=sandra.maler&amp;">Sandra Maler</a>, <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=cynthia.osterman&amp;">Cynthia Osterman</a> and <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=bernard.orr&amp;">Bernard Orr</a>)</p><span id="midArticle_12"/></div>
