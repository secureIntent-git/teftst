                    <p> LONDON — Boris Johnson has earned a reputation as Britain's most flamboyant politician, a man whose impressive vocabulary is matched only by his ability to offend at every turn. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> So eyebrows were raised when <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/brexit-referendum/theresa-may-bloody-difficult-woman-be-u-k-prime-minister-n608001">Britain's new prime minister, Theresa May,</a> named <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/brash-former-london-mayor-boris-johnson-named-british-foreign-secretary-n608736">Johnson as foreign secretary</a> in her Cabinet on Wednesday. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> The job is one of the most senior roles in the British government. Like Secretary of State John Kerry, the British foreign secretary acts as the country's top diplomat. </p>

                    <p> Clinton, he said, had carried out the job of First Lady like "Lady Macbeth, stamping her heel, bawling out subordinates and frisbeeing ashtrays at her erring husband." </p>

                    <p> Johnson provided one of his typically humorous assessments on Russian President Vladimir Putin in Dec. 2015, comparing the leader to a character from the "Harry Potter" franchise. </p>

                    <p> This was in response to a lawsuit brought by Erdogan against a German comedian who went on television and recited an insulting poem about the Turkish leader. </p>

                    <p> Johnson was forced to apologize for <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3571742/If-Blairs-so-good-at-running-the-Congo-let-him-stay-there.html">a 2002 newspaper column</a> in which he used several racist words to describe the then-Prime Minister Tony Blair's visits to other countries. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> He suggested Blair would be greeted "with crowds of flag-waving piccaninnies" — an offensive term for a black child. He added that when the prime minister touched down in the Congo, the "tribal warriors will all break out in watermelon smiles." </p>
                
              
              
              
                
              
              
              
                
                    
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
              
              
              
                    <p> It was not until 2008 that Johnson apologized for the words. He said they were taken out of context and was "very sad that people have been so offended." </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> He added: "I'm absolutely 100 per cent anti-racist, I despise and loathe racism," and urged black Londoners who were outraged by the comments to "move on" and focus on other issues. </p>
