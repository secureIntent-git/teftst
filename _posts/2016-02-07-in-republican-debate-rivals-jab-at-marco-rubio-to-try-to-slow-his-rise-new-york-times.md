That’s truancy.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="464" data-total-count="1890" itemprop="articleBody">The scorn aimed at Mr. Rubio, a 44-year-old first-term senator, came as voters in New Hampshire and nationwide are still taking the measure of him, though he is well positioned to surge nationally if he has a strong showing in the primary here. Still, a Boston Globe/Suffolk University poll last week indicated there was still fluidity in the New Hampshire electorate: 33 percent of Republican primary voters here said they might change their minds before Tuesday.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="691" data-total-count="2581" itemprop="articleBody">The intensity of the debate reflected the stakes, as several candidates face possible elimination if they fail to finish strongly here. Mr. Christie, who had just $1 million left for his campaign at the start of the year, is almost certain to exit the race if he does not outperform his establishment-aligned rivals. Mr. Bush and Gov. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/john-kasich-on-the-issues.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about John Kasich." class="meta-per">John Kasich</a> of Ohio are facing nearly as much pressure to demonstrate that they can appeal to voters after being overshadowed by more conservative candidates.

The New Jersey governor, after rising in New Hampshire polls at the end of last year, has fallen here after facing an onslaught from a “<a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/campaign_finance/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about Super PACs." class="meta-classifier">super PAC</a>” supporting Mr. Rubio.

After several debates where Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz were the most aggressive candidates, they appeared to be protecting their political advantages as they look to build on the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary for a protracted fight for the nomination. At one point, however, during an exchange with Mr. Bush, Mr. Trump took aim at the audience — a risk so soon before the state’s primary.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="404" data-total-count="6226" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-9">“He wants to be a tough guy, and it doesn’t work very well,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Bush.

Mr. Trump denounced those booing as “all of his donors and special interests,” drawing more jeers. “The reason they’re not loving me is I don’t want their money,” Mr. Trump said.</p><figure id="0206gop-debate-ced" class="interactive interactive-embedded  has-adjacency limit-xsmall layout-small"><a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-10">Continue reading the main story</a>

Mr. Cruz sought to find a middle way, leaving open the possibility that he would engage in what is seen as torture. “I would not bring it back in any widespread use,” he said of waterboarding.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="215" data-total-count="7537" itemprop="articleBody"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/ben-carson-on-the-issues.html?inline=nyt-per" title="" class="meta-per">Ben Carson</a>, the retired neurosurgeon who has largely faded as a candidate in recent weeks, deftly cut down Mr. Cruz for incorrectly spreading a message that Mr. Carson had dropped out right before the Iowa caucuses.</p>
