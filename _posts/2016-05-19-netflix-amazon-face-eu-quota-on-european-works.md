<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocation">BRUSSELS</span> Online video streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime will be required to devote at least a fifth of their catalogs to European content under proposals set to be announced next week.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The European Commission is planning an overhaul of the European Union's broadcasting rules to bring in EU-wide minimum quotas in a bid to boost the circulation and funding of European films and television shows.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>On-demand services will have to ensure they have at least a 20 percent share of European works in their catalog and ensure their "prominence", according to a draft of the proposed Audiovisual Media Services Directive seen by Reuters.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>European films already account for 27 percent of films shown on streaming services, according to a study undertaken for the Commission, and account for 21 percent of films on Netflix.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>EU member states will also have the option of requiring streaming services not based in that country but targeting their audience to contribute financially to the production of European works, such as by directly investing in them or by paying into national funds.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Under the current rules member states can only make on-demand services based in their jurisdiction pay into European content.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The Commission wants to avoid forum-shopping whereby companies set up in countries with light financial obligations, such as Luxembourg and the Netherlands.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>According to the Commission, TV broadcasters invest around 20 percent of their revenue in European content, whereas the share drops to 1 percent for on-demand providers.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>"It is clear that the current film financing system is being challenged by quick changes in production, distribution and consumption, triggered by digital technologies," Guenther Oettinger, the EU's digital Commissioner, said in Cannes on the sidelines of Europe's leading film festival.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Some critics say EU leaders should let the market ensure good quality content. Daniel Dalton, a member of the European Parliament for Britain's ruling Conservative part, condemned "digital protectionism" that would not foster good film-making: </p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>"The European Commission has yet again failed to understand how the digital world works. Subscription services like Netflix and Amazon should consider only one thing when placing content on their platforms: what their viewers want to watch."</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Current broadcasting rules require on-demand services to promote the production of and access to European works, without specifying quotas. However, in response to this, over half of the EU's 28 members have introduced national quotas. Traditional broadcasters have to reserve over half of their transmission time to European works.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>In France, for example, on-demand services such as Netflix are already forced to reserve 60 percent of their catalog for European content.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>The new proposal will also make video-sharing platforms such as YouTube impose stricter age barriers for minors to protect them from harmful content.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>The Commission is set to announce the proposal on May 25 together with a law banning so-called geoblocking, the practice whereby websites treat customers differently depending on their country of residence, either by re-routing them to their home version or banning their access altogether.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><span id="midArticle_16"/><p> (Additional reporting by Alastair Macdonald; Editing by David Evans, Bernard Orr)</p><span id="midArticle_17"/></div>
