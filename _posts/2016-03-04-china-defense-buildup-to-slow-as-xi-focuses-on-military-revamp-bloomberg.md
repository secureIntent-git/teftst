<br><div readability="48.838235294118"> <p>The pace of China’s defense spending growth will slow to between 7 and 8 percent this year as President Xi Jinping focuses on the most sweeping military overhaul in decades in an effort to improve the ability of the nation’s armed forces to fight and win wars.</p><p>The increase is the least since at least 2010 when spending climbed 7.7 percent, according to data from National Bureau of Statistics of China. The spending estimate was announced before Saturday’s start of the annual National People’s Congress in Beijing. Last year military spending was budgeted to rise 10 percent to 886.9 billion yuan ($136 billion).</p><p>Xi’s revamp is aimed at unifying the People’s Liberation Army, Navy, Air Force and a new Rocket Force under one command, enabling the armed forces to better defend China’s sovereignty at home and its growing interests abroad. The transformation of the large, mostly land-based army that hasn’t fought a conflict since 1979 has implications for militaries in the Asia-Pacific that is rife with territorial disputes, and for the U.S., which is beefing up its engagement in Asia.</p> </div>
