        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"The recent resignation of Zenefits' CEO Parker Conrad is an important development, but it does not resolve our ongoing investigation of Zenefits' business practices and their compliance with California law and regulations," Jones said.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The department said it will not release information about its findings until the investigation is complete.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Zenefits did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment on California's investigation.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The investigation was first reported by media outlet BuzzFeed on Thursday. The news site had also previously reported, following BuzzFeed's investigation of the company, that Zenefits allowed salespeople without licenses to act as insurance brokers in at least seven states.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>San Francisco-based Zenefits is also under investigation by the Washington State Office of the Insurance Commissioner, a spokesman for the agency confirmed to Reuters in an email, for what was described as "unlicensed sales related to insurance policies."</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>"The investigation could result in some kind of enforcement action, but that is still undetermined," wrote Steve Valandra, the agency's deputy commissioner for public affairs.Zenefits provides free software for businesses to manage stock options, maternity leave and vacation time, among other benefits. The company makes money acting as a high-tech health insurance broker, working as the middleman between businesses and healthcare providers such as Anthem Blue Cross, and earning the commission or broker fee.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Zenefits' newly appointed CEO, David Sacks, who joined the company a year ago as chief operating officer, confirmed  compliance issues in a letter to employees on Monday that was seen by Reuters. </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>"The fact is that many of our internal processes, controls, and actions around compliance have been inadequate, and some decisions have just been plain wrong," Sacks said in the letter. </p><span id="midArticle_13"/><span id="midArticle_14"/><p> (Reporting by Heather Somerville; Editing by <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=diane.craft&amp;">Diane Craft</a>)</p><span id="midArticle_15"/></div>
