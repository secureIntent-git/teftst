(Charleston County Sheriff’s Office via AP)</p> </div> <p>The former South Carolina police officer who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/04/07/south-carolina-police-officer-will-be-charged-with-murder-after-shooting/?tid=a_inl" target="_blank">shot and killed Walter Scott</a> as he fled a traffic stop last year was indicted by a federal grand jury that charged him with a civil rights violation.</p> <p>In the indictment filed Tuesday, the grand jury accuses Michael Slager, a former North Charleston police officer, of depriving Scott of his rights under color of law. The grand jury said that when Slager shot Scott “without legal justification” in April 2015, he took away his constitutional right “to be free from the use of unreasonable force by a law enforcement officer.”</p> <p>Slager is also charged with obstruction of justice, with the grand jury saying that he knowingly misled state investigators by telling them that that Scott, who was not armed, was approaching him with a Taser. He was also charged with one count of using a weapon during “a felony crime of violence.”</p> <p>It was not immediately clear who would be representing Slager in this case. Magistrate Judge Bristow Marchant also signed an order Tuesday for a warrant to be issued for Slager’s arrest, and the former officer was turned in to the FBI on Wednesday morning, according to Andrew J. Savage III, an attorney defending the former officer in the state’s murder case.</p> <p>Savage said that his partner would be representing Slager during a hearing Wednesday on the federal charges but said that since prosecutors can seek a death sentence for the civil rights charge, he has asked that another firm be appointed in the case.</p> <p channel="wp.com" class="interstitial-link"> <i> [<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/04/09/look-for-justice-a-shooting-in-south-carolina-and-the-power-of-video/">‘Look for justice': A shooting in South Carolina and the power of video</a>] </i> </p> <p>The Justice Department said in a statement Wednesday that Slager could face up to life in prison for the civil rights violation as well as a possible $250,000 fine.</p> <p>Scott’s death was one of several high-profile incidents last year that fueled a debate over how police use lethal force. Video footage of the shooting, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/04/07/south-carolina-police-officer-will-be-charged-with-murder-after-shooting/" target="_blank">captured by a bystander’s cellphone</a>, was widely seen on cable news and social media.</p> <div class="inline-content inline-video" readability="35">  <p> <span class="pb-caption">The dash cam from North Charleston, S.C. police officer Michael Slager's vehicle shows the initial traffic stop and interaction that preceded Slager shooting and killing Walter Scott. (South Carolina Law Enforcement Division)</span> </p> </div> <p>Two videos of the encounter showed how it began with a routine traffic stop. Dashboard camera footage from Slager’s police car showed him telling Scott he pulled him over because of a broken brake light; a short time later, Scott is seen running away. In another recording, this one taken by a bystander who was walking to work, Scott is seen running across a tree-lined patch of grass as Slager fired multiple shots, and, according to an affidavit filed in the case, hitting the fleeing Scott “multiple times in the back.”</p> <p>Slager was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/06/08/police-officer-who-shot-walter-scott-indicted-for-murder/" target="_blank">indicted last June</a> by a state grand jury on a murder charge, and could face up to life in prison if he is convicted, according to prosecutors. The exact date of his state trial is <a href="http://www.postandcourier.com/20160503/160509787/with-federal-action-possible-trial-date-for-ex-officer-michael-slager-is-disputed" target="_blank">up in the air</a>, as state prosecutors — who are also working on <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/04/13/lawyers-ask-to-delay-charleston-church-shooting-trial/" target="_blank">the delayed trial against the man accused of killing nine black parishioners in a Charleston church</a> <strong>— </strong> have asked for it to be pushed back.</p> <p>He was one of just 10 officers who were charged with a crime in connection to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings/" target="_blank">the 990 fatal police shootings last year</a>, according to a Washington Post database.</p> <p>Federal civil rights charges are even rarer. An investigation earlier this year by the <a href="http://triblive.com/usworld/nation/9939487-74/police-rights-civil" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Tribune-Review</a> found that the Justice Department has declined to bring federal charges in 96 percent of the more than 13,000 federal civil rights complaints against police officers they’ve received since 1995.</p> <div class="inline-content inline-photo-right" style="width:287px;"> <a name="c73c09ade3"/> <img alt="This undated photo provided by Anthony Scott shows Walter Scott, who was killed by a North Charleston, S.C., police officer after a traffic stop on Saturday, April 4, 2015.

(Anthony Scott via AP)</span> </div> <p>Chris Stewart, an attorney for the Scott family, said he was relieved and excited by the news of the federal indictment, which he called a historic step toward justice in police brutality cases.</p> <p>“Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, all of them, every significant case the Justice Department has investigated and no indictments came down. This is the first time that an indictment has come down in a national case,” Stewart said. “I’m still in a state of shock … I don’t know in the past 20 years out of thousands of allegations of police misconduct how often this has happened, if it ever has. The biggest thing is that the general public must understand is how monumental this is.”</p> <p channel="wp.com" class="interstitial-link"> <i> [<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/police-shootings-2016/">The Post’s database of police shootings this year</a>] </i> </p> <p>Stewart said the indictment has brought further vindication to the Scott family.</p> <p>“They are beyond relived and just, they feel vindicated,” Stewart said. “They can’t bring Walter back, but if Walter can be the reason that the federal government starts taking these cases … if Walter Scott can be that example than his death wasn’t in vain.”</p> <p>The indictment was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Division of South Carolina. While it was received by the court Tuesday and initially sealed, Marchant, the magistrate judge, on Wednesday granted a government motion to unseal the case.</p> <p><strong>Further reading:</strong></p> <p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/10/08/north-charleston-reaches-6-5-million-settlement-with-walter-scotts-family/" target="_blank">North Charleston reaches $6.5 million dollar settlement with Scott family</a></p> <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/investigative/2015/04/11/thousands-dead-few-prosecuted/" target="_blank">Thousands dead, few prosecuted: An investigation into police shootings</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/fatal-police-shootings-in-2015-approaching-400-nationwide/2015/05/30/d322256a-058e-11e5-a428-c984eb077d4e_story.html" target="_blank">Fatal police shootings in 2015: An attempt to document a previously unknown number</a></p> <p><em>This story has been updated.</em></p></div>
