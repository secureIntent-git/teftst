<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="7"><p><span class="articleLocation">CULIACAN, Mexico/WASHINGTON</span> Efforts to combat illegal gunrunning from the United States to Mexico have stumbled in recent years, hampered by a lack of  cooperation between U.S. and Mexican officials, according to a report from a U.S. federal watchdog agency obtained by Reuters.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The draft report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO), finalized after the latest arrest of Mexican drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, also criticized U.S. law enforcement agencies for not ensuring they are effectively working together to fight arms smuggling by Mexico's ruthless drug cartels.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Squabbling between U.S. authorities and Mexico over Guzman has put an intense focus on the issue of cooperation. Mexico, which refused to extradite him to the United States when he was arrested in 2014, was formally starting extradition proceedings against Guzman after his latest capture.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"Efforts to stem firearms trafficking between the United States and Mexico were scaled back as the administration of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto reconsidered bilateral law enforcement cooperation," the report said, citing U.S. and Mexican officials.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Mexico tightly restricts gun sales but the flow south of U.S. weapons helped fuel battles between drug gangs and security forces that have killed more than 100,000 people since 2007. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Experts say operations to stem the flow of guns south have had little success, pointing to the botched "Fast and Furious" sting in which U.S. agents lost track of guns allowed to enter Mexico between 2009 and 2011.  </p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The GAO report was commissioned by U.S. Representative Eliot Engel as a follow-up to a similar GAO study in 2009. The agency is expected to release it later on Monday.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"Congress has a responsibility to do much more to stop the illegal flow of guns across the U.S.-Mexico border," said Engel, a Democrat. Calls to tighten U.S. gun laws have run into stiff opposition in Washington, largely from Republicans despite high-profile mass shootings in the United States.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>SHIFT IN POLICY </p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Pena Nieto dialed back cooperation with U.S. authorities after taking office in late 2012. U.S.-Mexico law enforcement ties, long undermined by mutual distrust, had improved under Pena Nieto's predecessor, Felipe Calderon.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Upon taking office, Pena Nieto's administration balked at the extent of U.S. involvement in Calderon's war against drug gangs and his team limited U.S. law enforcement access.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>The report said collaboration between the two countries has improved in the last year, but cited concerns about corruption among Mexican authorities. Pena Nieto replaced his attorney general last year with an official more open to working with the U.S. government than her predecessor.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Of nearly 105,000 guns seized in Mexico and submitted for tracing from 2009 to 2014, 70 percent came from the United States, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) cited in the study.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Another 17 percent were traced to other countries, while 13 percent could not be tracked, possibly due to the failure of U.S. gun shops that closed down to turn over records. </p><span id="midArticle_15"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Available data showed a drop since 2011 in the number of weapons confiscated by security forces in Mexico and traced to the United States. </p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>The report also said the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and ATF have failed to ensure their agents are effectively cooperating on arms trafficking investigations. </p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The GAO said it found persistent gaps in information-sharing between ATF and ICE, and confusion about their roles even after the 2009 GAO report pushed them to improve teamwork. </p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Mexican lawmakers and experts claimed lax U.S. gun control is the main reason for the ease with which traffickers buy and move guns. They also blamed corruption among Mexican customs agents.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"The fight against arms trafficking has been a failure," said Raul Benitez, a security expert at the National Autonomous University in Mexico.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><span id="midArticle_5"/><p> (Reporting by Michael O'Boyle in Culiacan, Mexico and Patricia Zengerle in Washington Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)</p><span id="midArticle_6"/></div>
