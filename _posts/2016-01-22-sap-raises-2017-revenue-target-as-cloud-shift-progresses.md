<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">WALLDORF, Germany</span> German software maker SAP on Friday raised its 2017 revenue outlook to the upper end of forecasts but said operating margins would dip as more business comes from cheaper Internet-based cloud software instead of legacy software packages.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>SAP's mid-term outlook issued on Friday follows strong results for 2015 and a somewhat cautious outlook for this year  as the company adapts to growing demand for cloud software paid by subscription rather than high-margin packaged products on which it has long counted. </p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Shares of Europe's largest software maker slipped 2 percent at 0955 GMT making it the worst performer in the STOXX Europe 600 Technology, which was up 1.5 percent. The new outlook implies an operating margin around 29.5 percent, well below the historic margins 35 percent SAP once targeted when it focused mainly on packaged software.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Analysts had expected a slightly slower decline in operating margin to 30 percent in 2017 from 30.5 percent in 2015.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Chief Financial Officer Luka Mucic said operating margin trends would depend on how fast the cloud business grew relative to the classic packaged software business but would drive higher profit levels over the long term. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>"There is no structural reason why operating margins of our cloud business should not exceed those of our classical on-premise business," Mucic told journalists on a conference call, but emphasized this was unlikely to happen until after 2020.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Cloud-based software subscriptions incur smaller upfront license fees, and are thus less profitable in the short term, but SAP is counting on ongoing subscription payments to bring in higher revenues, and eventually higher profits, over time.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>SAP is still growing faster than competitors Oracle and IBM, all of which must boost Internet-based sales to head off cloud-based rivals Salesforce.com, Workday and Amazon.com's Web services unit.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>OUTLOOK "NOT SPECTACULAR"</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Last week, the company outlined better than expected 2015 results, fueled by strong year-end renewals by existing software license customers, but cautioned that 2016 profit would be at the low end of expectations.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>It forecast 2016 operating profit, excluding special items, would be between 6.4 billion and 6.7 billion euros ($7.0-7.3 billion).     </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>The company said it now expects 2017 revenue in the range of 23.0 billion to 23.5 billion euros, at or above the average analyst expectation of 23.01 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>SAP said it is now targeting 2017 operating profit in the range of 6.7 billion to 7.0 billion euros. The midpoint of that range, 6.85 billion, is slightly below the 6.905 billion  mean estimate among analysts, according to Thomson Reuters data.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>On the same basis, a year ago, SAP had forecast total 2017 revenue of between 21 billion and 22 billion euros and operating profit in a range between 6.3 billion and 7.0 billion euros.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>"The 2017 forecast is not spectacular: SAP expects what the consensus expects'" said one analyst at a German bank, who asked not to be named.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>SAP's newer cloud products include software used to manage corporate travel, procurement and temporary workers. Its software is relied upon by many of the world's biggest multinational firms to manage cross-border business operations.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><span id="midArticle_2"/><span id="midArticle_3"/><p> (Additional reporting by <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=ilona.wissenbach&amp;">Ilona Wissenbach</a>; Editing by <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=keith.weir&amp;">Keith Weir</a>)</p><span id="midArticle_4"/></div>
