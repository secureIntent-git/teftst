		<p class="TEXT_w_Indent">The vacancy helped the liberals this time. The deadlocked vote came in a case that considered whether unions representing government employees can collect fees from workers who choose not to join. California teachers backed by a conservative group said being forced to pay union fees violated free-speech rights of nonmembers who disagree with the union's policies.</p>
<p class="TEXT_w_Indent">The split vote left in place an appeals court ruling that upheld the collection of "fair share" fees from nonmembers.</p>
<p class="TEXT_w_Indent">The result was an unlikely reprieve for organized labor. It had seemed certain that the high court would rule 5-4 to overturn a system that's been in place nearly 40 years. But the court now is operating with only eight justices after the Feb. 13 death of Scalia, who had been expected to rule against the unions.</p>
<p class="TEXT_w_Indent">The one-sentence opinion issued Tuesday did not identify how each justice voted. It simply upheld a decision from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>
<p class="TEXT_w_Indent">But it was a blow to conservative groups that have spent years pushing the court to overrule a 1977 precedent that allows unions to collect fees from members and non-members alike to cover the costs of collective bargaining.</p>
<p class="TEXT_w_Indent">Union officials feared a ruling barring the fees would threaten membership and further weaken the clout of unions, which are major supporters of Democratic candidates and causes.  </p>
<p class="TEXT_w_Indent">The tie vote came amid a political standoff over Obama's nomination of appellate judge Merrick Garland to fill Scalia's vacant seat. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the 4-4 tie rather than a majority ruling "is not what our founders intended."</p>
<p class="TEXT_w_Indent">But conservative groups said the split underscored the risk of replacing Scalia with someone more liberal. Confirming Garland would make the court "a rubber stamp not just for the wishes of powerful labor unions, but also for virtually the entire progressive agenda," said Curt Levey, executive director of the FreedomWorks Foundation.</p>
<p class="TEXT_w_Indent">The union case is just one among a handful of key disputes this term in which Scalia's vote had been expected to tip the balance toward a conservative result. During arguments in the case in January, Scalia and the court's four other conservatives had made it clear they were prepared to deal a blow to the unions.</p>
<p class="TEXT_w_Indent">Since Supreme Court decisions are not final until they're handed down, nothing Scalia said in connection with the case before his death mattered in the outcome.</p>
<p class="TEXT_w_Indent">A similar split between the court's liberals and conservatives was evident last week when the justices heard appeals from faith-based groups objecting to an Obama administration effort to ensure their employees and students can get cost-free birth control. The court Tuesday directed both sides to file a new round of briefs exploring a possible compromise, setting an April 20 deadline. </p>
