<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocation">SAN FRANCISCO</span> Uber has agreed to pay up to $100 million to settle a class-action lawsuit which resolves a major challenge to its business model by allowing the ride-hailing service to keep its California and Massachusetts drivers as independent contractors.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The lawsuit had claimed that Uber [UBER.UL] drivers are employees and thus entitled to reimbursement of expenses.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The case against Uber had been closely watched in Silicon Valley, as other companies in the on-demand tech economy share Uber's reliance on independent contractors. The class action had been scheduled for a trial in San Francisco federal court in June.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"We realize that some will be disappointed not to see this case go to trial," said Shannon Liss-Riordan, an attorney for drivers.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>However, Liss-Riordan said the plaintiff drivers faced significant risks of losing if the case moved forward, particularly because a federal appeals court had recently agreed to review an order allowing Uber drivers to sue as a group. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Nothing about the settlement prevents a future court, or U.S. labor authorities, from deeming Uber drivers as employees, she said in a statement.  </p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>DRIVER DEACTIVATION</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Out of the $100 million proposed payment, $84 million is guaranteed to drivers. Uber could also pay an additional $16 million, but only if the company's valuation grows by 150 percent above its December 2015 financing round within a year after any initial public offering. </p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Uber was valued at $62.5 billion in that December funding round.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Uber agreed to some changes in its business practices, including the institution of a policy for deactivation of drivers, chief executive Travis Kalanick said in a blog post about the settlement. Some drivers had long complained that Uber arbitrarily terminated users from its platform.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Uber is "pleased" that the deal "recognizes that drivers should remain as independent contractors, not employees," Kalanick said in the post.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>The company also agreed to help create a drivers' association in both states. Liss-Riordan said that while such groups are not officially a union, they can act like a union in bringing grievances to management's attention.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>The settlement is similar to a separate agreement announced with Lyft drivers earlier this year, though the Uber agreement is much larger given that Uber has many more drivers.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Over 450,000 U.S. drivers currently use the app each month, Kalanick said in the blog post. </p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>The Uber deal must be approved by U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><span id="midArticle_1"/><p> (Reporting by Dan Levine; Additional reporting by Heather Somerville; Editing by Michael Perry and Muralikumar Anantharaman)</p><span id="midArticle_2"/></div>
