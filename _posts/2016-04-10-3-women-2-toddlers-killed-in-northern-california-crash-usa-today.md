Bradley said witnesses at the scene saw the car speeding on the 55-mph highway, trying to pass other cars on two-way traffic.</p><p>"I've worked in this area for almost 19 years, and on Saturdays, that stretch of roadway is extremely busy," Bradley said.</p><p><span style="line-height:1.6">Before the crash, the Civic passed a car in front of it in the eastbound lane. The  Civic entered the opposite lane again but had no space to make the pass.  The driver lost control of the vehicle as it headed back onto the eastbound lane, having "overcorrected" herself, Bradley said. The car swerved counterclockwise onto the westbound side, where it was struck in the passenger side by the Silverado.</span></p><p>Four people were in the Silverado. They were taken to the hospital to be treated for minor injuries.</p><p>Bradley said drivers on State Route 12 tend to speed or try passing each other on the rural roadway, putting themselves and other motorists in danger.</p><p>"Driving takes 100% of your attention, and you have to have a better plan and have a good plan to get to your location safely," Bradley said. "It’s unnecessary speeding or unsafe passing that’s costing people their lives."</p><p><em>Follow Digital Editor Steph Solis at <a href="http://www.twitter.com/stephmsolis">@stephmsolis</a>.</em></p><!-- cxenseparse_end --><p>Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1S3ptmN</p></div>
