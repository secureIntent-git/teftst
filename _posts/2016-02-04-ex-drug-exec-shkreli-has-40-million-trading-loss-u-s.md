<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">NEW YORK</span> Former pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli suffered a roughly $40 million drop in the value of a trading account used to secure his bail following his arrest on securities fraud charges, a U.S. prosecutor said on Wednesday.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>At a hearing in federal court in Brooklyn, Assistant U.S. Attorney Winston Paes said the account contained mostly shares of KaloBios Pharmaceuticals Inc KBIOQ.PK, a drug company that Shkreli briefly ran.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>KaloBios filed for bankruptcy in December, wiping out most of its equity value. That caused the value of Shkreli's E*Trade brokerage account to drop to $4 million to $5 million, from the $45 million level when it had been frozen, the prosecutor said.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Paes told U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto that Shkreli may need to post new assets to secure his $5 million bond, which was issued following the 32-year-old's arrest in December.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Shkreli's new laywer, Benjamin Brafman, responded, "There's nothing like an indictment to affect the price of shares even if the shares have significant value."</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Shkreli's criminal case arose from his prior management of hedge fund MSMB Capital Management and Retrophin Inc (<span id="symbol_RTRX.O_1">RTRX.O</span>), a biopharmaceutical company where he was chief executive before being fired in 2014.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Prosecutors said Shkreli engaged in a Ponzi-like scheme in which he defrauded investors in MSMB, and misappropriated $11 million in assets from Retrophin to repay them. He has pleaded not guilty.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Shkreli's arrest came soon after Turing Pharmaceuticals, another company he headed at the time, caused a public outcry by raising the price of a drug used to treat a dangerous parasitic infection to $750 from $13.50.Since his arrest, Shkreli has remained active on social media and given interviews to the press.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Some of that may now end.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Brafman, whose clients have included former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn and rapper Sean "Diddy" Combs, told reporters that as a condition of his hiring, Shkreli was to stop talking to the media.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>"We want to try this case in court, not the media," Brafman said.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Shkreli is expected to appear on Thursday at a congressional hearing on drug pricing, and assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination under the U.S. Constitution.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>In a separate case, a federal judge in Manhattan on Tuesday gave preliminary approval to a $3 million class action settlement for Retrophin shareholders, based on many claims at issue in Shkreli's criminal prosecution.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/></div>
