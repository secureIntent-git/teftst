<br><div id="start-of-content"><p>Nowadays, turbochargers are found anywhere you find cars. They’re an established tool for increasing engine power without burning up a T-Rex worth of gasoline, and come in everything from Formula One cars to the new Ford Fiesta.</p>
<p>At its most basic, a turborcharger uses a fan turned by the exhaust to force more air into the engine, creating more powerful combustion. The tech dates to the dawn of internal combustion and has been bolted into everything from airplanes to motorcycles and, of course, automobiles. Oldsmobile was the first to use it on passenger cars, introducing it in 1962, followed by Chevrolet, which offered a turbocharged Corvair, of all things. </p>
<p>But it was Porsche that really showed what a turbo could do, namely, deliver utterly bonkers power in the already sweet 911/930. Nothing makes you shake like a <a href="http://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/features/a4576/porsche-934-vs-porsche-935-track-drive/" target="_blank">935 running flat-out</a>.</p>
<p>In <em>Porsche Turbo</em>, journalist and photographer Randy Leffingwell tells the story of the automaker’s long relationship with forced induction. The racing-obsessed German outfit first picked up the turbo in 1975, using it to get around increasingly strict fuel use restrictions in the 917 coupe. From there, the technology moved into consumer cars, and in the past 40 years it’s been an integral part of Porsche’s legacy.</p>
