It usually takes a year or more for export curbs to be removed for a company, but the U.S. government can act much more quickly.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>ZTE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.    </p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Trading in ZTE shares, which has been halted since March 7 in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, was expected to resume on Wednesday, according to the source, who declined to be identified because the information has not been made public.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Two other sources familiar with ZTE, which has been undertaking an extensive lobbying effort in Washington, said the company was blindsided by the severity of the trade ban.  </p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>"It's going to have a big impact on the company, that's for sure," said a source with direct knowledge of the situation, describing the ruling as "unexpected". A second source close to the company said the restrictions were more severe than expected.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>In a statement last week, the Shenzhen, China-based company said it "has been working with associated U.S. government departments on investigations since 2012 and maintains constant communication with associated departments and is committed to fully address and resolve any concerns." </p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>The Chinese government also has strongly criticized the export curbs.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>The Commerce Department investigated ZTE for alleged export-control violations following reports by Reuters in 2012 that the company sold Iran a powerful surveillance system and millions of dollars in hardware and software from some of America's best-known technology companies.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Later that year, the U.S. Congress Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence recommended U.S. companies avoid using network gear from both ZTE and larger rival Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] due to their alleged connections with China's communist government and military.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><p> (Additional reporting by Yimou Lee in HONG KONG; Editing by Bernard Orr and Lincoln Feast)</p><span id="midArticle_14"/></div>
