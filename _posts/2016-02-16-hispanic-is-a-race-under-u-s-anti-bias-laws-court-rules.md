<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocation">WASHINGTON</span> The ethnic category “Hispanic” is a race under U.S. federal antidiscrimination laws, a U.S. appeals court ruled on Tuesday.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Christopher Barrella, a white candidate who was passed over for the position of police chief for the town of Freeport on New York's Long Island, filed a racial discrimination lawsuit in 2012 after the job went to Miguel Burmudez, a white Hispanic man. </p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Freeport argued in its defense that there could be no racial discrimination because Hispanic is not a distinct race.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>But a three-judge panel of the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the town's argument, finding that Hispanic has long been considered a separate race in civil rights cases. The judges pointed out that the U.S. Supreme Court has previously held that racial discrimination includes bias based on ancestry or ethnic characteristics.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The 2nd Circuit, which encompasses the states of New York, Connecticut and Vermont, also noted that it has repeatedly assumed ethnicity-based discrimination claims were understood as racially motivated without making an explicit ruling on that point.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>But though the panel ruled in favor of Barrella on how antidiscrimination laws treat ethnic categories, it also wiped out the $1.35 million verdict a jury had awarded him.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The judges cited a separate evidentiary issue in vacating the verdict and ordering a new trial, ruling that the trial court should not have allowed non-expert witnesses to speculate on Freeport Mayor Andrew Hardwick’s motivations for choosing Burmudez over Barrella.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Lawyers for Barrella, Freeport and Hardwick each expressed confidence that their clients will prevail when the dispute goes back before a federal jury.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Freeport named Burmudez as its chief of police in 2010 over Barrella, who had a higher promotional test score, more education and more time in rank. Barrella sued Freeport and Hardwick in federal court in Brooklyn in 2012. A jury handed down verdicts against both defendants in 2014, awarding $1 million for lost future pay, $200,000 in punitive damages and $150,000 in back wages, plus attorney fees.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>The appeal was set up when the trial judge denied Freeport’s post-verdict motion for a judgment as a matter of law on the grounds that Hispanic does not constitute a distinct race under antidiscrimination laws.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>The case is Freeport v. Barrella, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 14-2270, 14-2349, 14-4287, 14-4324 and 14-3615.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><span id="midArticle_12"/><p> (Reporting by Robert Iafolla, Editing by Anthony Lin)</p><span id="midArticle_13"/></div>
