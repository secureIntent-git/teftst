It elevates the W.H.O. to the position of global coordinator, and gives its decisions the force of international law. The agency is trying to cast itself as a global leader to revive its reputation after a faltering response during the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/e/ebola/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about ebola." class="meta-classifier">Ebola</a> epidemic in West Africa.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="174" data-total-count="1697" itemprop="articleBody">“Can you imagine if we do not do all this work now and wait until all these scientific evidence to come out, people will say why didn’t you take action?” Dr. Chan said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="382" data-total-count="2079" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-4">The current outbreak of Zika has taken the world by surprise. It was first identified in 1947 in Uganda, and for years lived mostly in monkeys. But last May in Brazil, cases began increasing drastically. The W.H.O. has estimated that four million people could be infected by the end of the year. It is spreading fast in the Americas because people there have not developed immunity.</p><figure id="breaking-news-email-promo" class="interactive interactive-embedded  has-adjacency  limit-small layout-small"><a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-5">Continue reading the main story</a>

</div><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="384" data-total-count="3560" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-7">But now that an emergency has been declared, the W.H.O. can issue global travel advisories, and crucially, coordinate global efforts to combat the mosquitoes that spread Zika, a role that is badly needed as mosquito populations are fluid and know no boundaries. The agency will also help coordinate surveillance efforts, including tracking and tallying cases of Zika and microcephaly.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="294" data-total-count="3854" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-8">The last time the W.H.O. declared a public health emergency was when Ebola was tearing through West Africa. But the agency was strongly criticized for weighing in very late, and many global health experts said it was unlikely that the agency’s director, Dr. Chan, would let that happen again.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="320" data-total-count="4174" itemprop="articleBody">“The W.H.O. took a very serious hit to their reputation,” said Dr. Ron Waldman, a professor of global health at the Milken School of Public Health at George Washington University. “They do have to be mindful of the politics, but they have to get the science right, too. They don’t have much room for slip-ups.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="350" data-total-count="4524" itemprop="articleBody">Zika and Ebola are very different. Ebola was incredibly deadly, and it spread through contact with bodily fluids. Zika is not known to be fatal, and it has mild symptoms for most people. So far, the evidence is inconclusive that the virus is the cause of the birth defects, so some health officials had been cautious about drawing too dire a picture.</p>
