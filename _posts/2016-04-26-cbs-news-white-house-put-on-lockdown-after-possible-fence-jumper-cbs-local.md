<p><strong>WASHINGTON (CBSNewYork)</strong> — The White House was put on lockdown after a possible fence jumper, CBS News reports.</p>
<p>The lockdown has since been lifted.</p>

<p>A pool report read that the “White House appears to be in a state of lockdown.”</p>

<p>“The door from outside to the Brady Briefing Room is locked. When your pooler tried to exit from the rear, Secret Service told him to remain inside,” the report read.</p>
<p>Associated Press White House reporter Josh Lederman tweeted, “The North Lawn as seen now from inside the White House. We are in lockdown but all seems mostly calm.”</p>

<p>The Secret Service has dealt with several fence jumpers over the past couple of years.</p>
