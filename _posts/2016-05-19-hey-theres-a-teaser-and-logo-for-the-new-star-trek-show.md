<p>While CBS’ upfronts presentation today was largely confined to its new shows coming next season, the network took the opportunity to unveil the very first teaser for its new <em>Star Trek</em> series. Set to debut in 2017—the pilot will premiere on CBS, with the show at large being exclusive to new streaming service CBS All Access—the new series will be helmed by <em>Hannibal</em> creator Bryan Fuller, who has the <em>Trek</em> <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/02/bryan-fuller-star-trek-series/" target="_blank">bonafides</a> to merit attention.</p>
<p>The teaser is less than a minute, and shows off exactly zero new footage, but its CGI sequence culminates in the tagline that the show will feature “new crews, new villains, new heroes, new worlds.” Unfortunately, that’s all anyone will get for now; network president Les Moonves ribbed the crowd by saying, “You didn’t think we were going to show you the cast, did you?” Though Angela Bassett has <a href="http://screencrush.com/star-trek-angela-bassett-american-horror-story/" target="_blank">shot down rumors</a> that she was cast as a captain, the fact that Fuller has said in interviews that he wanted to cast her—along with Rosario Dawson as first officer—is reason enough to think that series will boldly go where no television series has gone since <em>Enterprise</em> went off the air over a decade ago.</p>
