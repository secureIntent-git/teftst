<br><div id="start-of-content"><article class="content link-underline relative body-copy" data-js="content" itemprop="articleBody" readability="37.210348706412"><p>New Hampshire residents took to the polls today, becoming the first in the country to cast their ballots in a presidential primary. While Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton walked away with first place finishes during the Iowa caucuses last week, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have been leading the New Hampshire polls for weeks. </p>
<p>Still, this state has a reputation for surprises, thanks to its large proportion of undecided voters. According to one recent poll, some 31 percent of Republican voters <a href="https://cola.unh.edu/sites/cola.unh.edu/files/research_publications/primary2016_gopprimary020816.pdf" target="_blank">were still undecided</a> as of yesterday. All that uncertainty has led to speculation that low-profile candidates like John Kasich may wind up getting a major boost while other “establishment” Republicans may have to call it quits. We’ll be liveblogging throughout the night from the Granite State as the results come in. Hope you’ll follow along!</p>
