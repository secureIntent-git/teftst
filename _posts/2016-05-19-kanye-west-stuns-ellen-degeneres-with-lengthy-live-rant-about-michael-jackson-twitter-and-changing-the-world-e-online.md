Now I understand why he didn't hit me back," he explained, adding that he has had dinner with Zuckerberg and his wife <strong>Priscilla Chan</strong> privately in the past. </p><p>"I feel that if I had more resources, I could help more people. I have ideas that could make the human race existence within our 100 years better—period." </p><p>The artist described a renaissance period he believes the world is currently experiencing, noting figures like Oscar-winning director <strong>Steve McQueen</strong> who started out as a fine arts student. "We're not in a place where people can only have one career, one profession throughout their entire life," he claimed. "I see the importance in the value of everyone being able to experience a more beautiful life."</p></section></div><div id="text-4" data-social-animate="true" data-hook="scrollable-block" data-align="left" readability="64.846153846154">

"Isn't that so funny that people point fingers at the people who have influenced us the most? They talk the most shit about the people who care the most. I'm sorry daytime television. I'm sorry for the realness."</p><p>As for the racial controversy surrounding the 2016 Oscar nominees, West made his stance very clear. </p><p>"I didn't take it as a joke," he said. "It ain't no joke."</p></section></div>
