Once again you’ve cooked up something small, but glorious. Apropos of nothing yesterday, “dongxipunata” posted the above image to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/" target="_blank">r/Oculus subreddit</a>. It tracks the eight (and counting moments) that VR appeared on <em>The Simpsons</em>, beginning with 1993’s unanimously beloved “Mr. Plow”—the year after <em>Lawnmower Man</em> hit theaters—and continuing through 2014’s <a href="http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/simpsons-days-future-future-203397" target="_blank">not-entirely-beloved</a> episode “Days of Future Future.”</p>
<p>When we first saw this, we admit, we assumed that dongxipunata had used <em>Simpsons</em> image-search engine <a href="http://wired.com/2016/02/ultimate-simpsons-search-engine-pairs-quotes-with-stills/" target="_blank">Frinkiac</a> to compile the list. However, searching for <a href="https://frinkiac.com/?p=search&amp;q=virtual" target="_blank">“virtual”</a> proved fruitless, and <a href="https://frinkiac.com/?p=search&amp;q=vr" target="_blank">“VR”</a> turned up little more than an episode of <em>Itchy &amp; Scratchy, </em>so we’re just gonna say the redditor in question knows magic.</p>
<p>Regardless of the image’s provenance, though, it holds up a mirror to what was actually going on vis a vis the abortive VR craze of the ’90s. Virtual-reality research at the time led to mainstream awareness, which led to speculative fiction like <em>Snow Crash, </em>which in turn led to a host of ’90s movies and TV shows that had fun with the concept—from <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtYdZkPmFoU" target="_blank">The 13th Floor</a></em> to <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lI3qIzRAafM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4m34s" target="_blank">Mad About You</a></em> to <em><a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/04/underwire_0402_murdershewrote/" target="_blank">Murder She Wrote</a></em>. Of course, nothing came of attempts to productize the technology that first go-round, and it wasn’t until <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/05/oculus-rift-4/" target="_blank">the Oculus Rift first popped up</a> in 2012 that VR became a watchword once again. (That doesn’t explain the 2011 episode, but since it was one of the Simpsons’ futuristic holiday episodes, it’s a little less curious.) Of course, you know what that means: we’re fast moving toward inevitable episode titles like “Brockulus Rift” and “D’oh! Crash.”</p>
