<br><div id="story" readability="132.13939980639">    <p>At least five people were stabbed, with some injured critically, during clashes between rallying neo-Nazis and counter-protesters at the Capitol in Sacramento on Sunday, fire officials said.</p><p>Five patients were transported to local hospitals with stab wounds, said Chris Harvey, public information officer for the Sacramento Fire Department. Several other people suffered cuts, scrapes and bruises but were not taken to the hospital, Harvey said.</p><p>"It was quite a bit of a melee," Harvey said, mentioning that several different groups had descended on the Capitol, including counter-protesters.</p><p>Harvey said he did not know which groups the stabbing victims were from.</p><p>Emergency responders got the call at roughly 11:45 am. The victims were spread out over the Capitol grounds, which covers multiple blocks in downtown Sacramento, Harvey said. As of 12:45 p.m. the crowds had been dispersed and most protesters had left the area.</p><p>The Traditionalist Worker Party, a white nationalist group, was holding a march Sunday “to protest against globalization and in defense of the right to free expression,” according to the group’s website. The members appeared to be vastly outnumbered by counter-protesters, who held up signs that read “Nazi scum,” according to photos and videos posted on social media. </p><p>An organizer of the rally who wasn’t at the Capitol, said on a web live stream that one person from his group had been stabbed and was being transported to the hospital.</p><p>“They got one of us but we got six of them,” he said.</p><p>Frances Wang, a local ABC10 reporter at the rally, wrote on Twitter that there were “blood spatters all over the ground. Police trying to control crowds.”</p><p>Video from ABC10 in Sacramento <a href="http://www.abc10.com/news/local/protests-taking-place-at-capitol-turn-violent/256289403" target="_blank">showed portions </a>of the clash.</p><figure class="raw-tweet full left conversation card">https://twitter.com/ABC10Frances/status/747144735442108416</figure><figure class="raw-tweet full left conversation card">https://twitter.com/ABC10Frances/status/747144187846373376</figure><p>Matthew Heimbach, chairman of the Traditionalist Worker Party who did not attend the rally, said his group and the Golden State Skinheads had organized the Sunday rally. </p><p>Vice Chairman Matt Parrott, who was not present at the Sacramento rally, said it was a peaceful march and blamed "leftist radicals" for instigating the violence. Heimbach said that in the clash, one of their marchers had been stabbed in the artery and six of the "anti-fascists" had also been stabbed.</p><p>"We knew we were outnumbered. We stood our ground. We will be back. This is a victory for us because more of them walked away injured," Heimbach said.</p><p>The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups, categorizes the organization as a white nationalist group. Parrott said the Traditionalist Worker Party supports ethnic nationalism, but was not violent nor "a supremacist party."</p><p>On its website, the group describes itself this way: “The Traditionalist Worker Party is America’s first political party created by and for working families. Our mission is defending faith, family, and folk against the politicians and oligarchs who are running America into the ground. We intend to achieve that goal by building a nationwide network of grassroots local leaders who will lead Americans toward a peaceful and prosperous future free from economic exploitation, federal tyranny, and anti-Christian degeneracy.”</p><p>The anti-fascist organization Antifa Sacramento, which had been promoting a "Shut Down Nazi Rally" event today on its website, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. </p><p> </p><figure class="raw-tweet full left conversation card">747163252832907266</figure><figure class="raw-tweet full left conversation card">747165062834487296</figure><figure class="raw-tweet full left conversation card">747139452825305089</figure><p><em>Ulloa reported from Sacramento; Reyes and Kim from Los Angeles.</em></p><p><strong><strong>ALSO</strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-kern-county-fire-damage-20160624-snap-story.html" target="_blank">Kern County fire evacuees struggle with another trauma — uncertainty</a></strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-san-gabriel-fire-20160626-snap-story.html" target="_blank">Drones force firefighters to temporarily halt air assault on wildfire</a></strong></strong></p><p><strong><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-bear-injury-campground-20160626-snap-story.html" target="_blank">Bear injures man in Angeles National Forest; officials order campground closed</a></strong></strong></p><br/><hr/><p><strong>UPDATES:</strong></p><p>1:46 p.m.: This article was updated with information on counter-protesters.</p><p>1:35 p.m.: This article was updated with interviews from group members.</p><p>1:15 p.m.: This post was updated with new details. </p><p><strong>1 p.m.: </strong>This post was updated with more information on injuries, and additional background.</p><p><em>This post was originally published at 12:35 p.m.</em></p></div>
