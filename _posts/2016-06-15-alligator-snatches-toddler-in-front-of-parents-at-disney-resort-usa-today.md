Helicopters, two marine units, sonar equipment, a dive team and an alligator trapper are being employed in the hunt for the toddler in the darkened waters.</p><p>The boy was playing in about a foot of water in a beach area with his father when he was taken by an alligator that witnesses described as anywhere from four to seven feet in length. "The father entered the water and he tried to grab the child, but was not successful in doing so," Demings said. The mother then rushed into the water and also tried to help rescue the boy. When the frantic couple was unable to pull their son to safety, they cried for help and a nearby lifeguard called 911.</p><p>The father received minor injuries to his hands as a result of his efforts.</p><p>The mother, father and their three children were staying at the resort while on vacation from Nebraska. They arrived Sunday, according to Demings.</p><p>The sheriff said he was "hopeful that we are able to locate the child in a reasonable period of time" but acknowledged there might not be a happy resolution to the search.</p><p>"As a father, as a grandfather, we're going to hope for the best in these circumstances, but based on my 35 years of law enforcement experience we know that we have some challenges ahead of us at this time," he said. "We'll be out throughout the night — the morning if you will — continuing this search until we have a successful resolution for this family."</p><div id="module-position-PHN15p8CZRw" class="story-asset image-asset" readability="32.5"><aside itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="wide single-photo" readability="5"><img itemprop="url" src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Alligator-snatches-toddler-in-front-of-parents-at-Disney-resort-USA-TODAY.jpg" alt="The Grand Floridian Resort &amp; Spa, located within walking" width="540" height="405" data-mycapture-src="" data-mycapture-sm-src=""/><meta itemprop="name" content="Gramd Floridian"/><meta itemprop="height" content="405"/><meta itemprop="width" content="540"/><p>The Grand Floridian Resort &amp; Spa, located within walking distance of a monorail ride to Magic Kingdom Park.<meta itemprop="copyrightHolder" content="Kent Phillips, Disney"/> <span class="credit">(Photo: Kent Phillips, Disney)</span></p></aside></div><p>Chad Weber from the Fish and Wildlife Commission said he was unaware of any reports of alligators in the area, but added that any such reports would be part of the investigation.</p><p>"We're putting every effort forward," Weber said.</p><p>"Everyone here at the Walt Disney World resort is devastated by this tragic accident," a spokeswoman for Disney said. "We are helping the family and doing everything we can to assist law enforcement."</p><p>There are posted signs warning guests against swimming in the lake, according to Demings.</p><p>The terrifying alligator attack at one of the World's favorite family vacation destination comes as the Orlando area is still reeling from the mass shooting at a nightclub that claimed 49 lives Saturday and the fatal shooting of singer Christina Grimmie at a concert Friday.</p><p>"We're doing our best to deal with all of the situations that we have going on here, but our staff is very resilient and tonight they are very focused on assisting this family," Demings said.</p><p>"We're not leaving until we recover the child," he said.</p><!-- cxenseparse_end --><p>Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1tpQ6dI</p></div>
