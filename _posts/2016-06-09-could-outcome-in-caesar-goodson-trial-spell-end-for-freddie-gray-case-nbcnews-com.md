                    <p> The Baltimore County prosecutor's office will on Thursday begin its highest profile and most pivotal case in the six Freddie Gray trials â€” the effort to convict Officer Caesar Goodson of "depraved-heart" murder. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> And in data exclusively obtained by NBC News, a conviction for Goodson would be the first of its kind in at least a decade. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Failure to net a conviction for Goodson, who was driving the police van when Gray sustained ultimately fatal spinal injuries, could spell an end to <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/baltimore-unrest/meet-marilyn-mosby-woman-overseeing-freddie-gray-investigation-n351046">Baltimore City State's Marilyn Mosby's </a>high-stakes legal gambit to send a message on combating police brutality. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> "She has a tremendous amount on the line, her entire career, particularly her credibility," said former Maryland prosecutor Rene Sandler. "She should take a strong look at the other cases, if there is another acquittal." </p>

                    <p> Goodson's defense team saw a more promising legal strategy in opting for a bench trial on Monday, which some legal experts say should effect the prosecution's counter-strategy. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> In a jury trial, the prosecution presents evidence to 12 members of a jury. Twelve different people work in tandem to return a verdict. In a bench trial, that job is put in the hands of one individual, the judge. </p>

                    <p> Prosecutors failed to obtain a guilty verdict in the previous trials of Officer William Porter, which ended in a mistrial in December, and Edward Nero, who opted for a bench trial and was acquitted last month. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Last year, Mosby <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/marilyn-mosby-officers-charged-death-freddie-gray#57176">charged</a> six officers in connection with Gray's death. </p>
                
              
              
              
                
              
              
              
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                    
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
              
              
              
                    <p> At the time Mosby's move was hailed by some as refreshingly aggressive and criticized by others as hasty and reactionary. </p>
                
              
                    
              
              
                    <p> "They came out swinging strong, too fast, revealing information in the beginning that may or may not have been supported in discovery. That's dangerous to do," said Sandler, the former prosecutor. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> The state over-dealt its hand, she said. Now prosecutors are going through the "fact by fact analysis of each officer" which isn't holding up the way they anticipated. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Either the "evidence they had wasn't as strong as they originally thought, or the strong evidence they have can't be presented," said Renee Hutchins, a professor at Maryland Carey School of Law. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> For example, the prosecution was dealt a blow on Monday when Circuit Judge Barry G. Williams ruled that Porter's alleged statement to Detective Syreeta Teel that he heard Gray say "I can't breathe" is <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/freddie-gray/bs-md-ci-goodson-trial-motions-20160606-story.html">not allowed</a> in evidence. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Prosecutors have also yet to make a strong case to show link between the officers' actions and outcome under legal standards, Sandler said adding "that is difficult to prove." </p>
                
              
              
              
                
              
              
              
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                    
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Add to the prosecution's challenges the fact that Williams, who will preside over Goodson's trial, is the same judge who declared a mistrial in the Porter case and issued an acquittal in the Nero case. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Police defendants are unique in that judges and juries tend not to convict, said Paul Butler, a professor at Georgetown School of Law. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Emotion can often play a big factor for juries said Baltimore area criminal defense attorney Warren Brown. But prosecutors in the Goodson case "now know that they can't seize upon the emotions of jury," he said. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> In the days following Gray's death, riots and violent protests broke out in Baltimore. Public opinion towards law enforcement plunged and the city's minority communities demanded justice. </p>
                
              
              
              
                
              
              
              
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                    
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
              
              
              
                    <p> This was one of the reasons why Mosby responded so strongly and swiftly in announcing charges, said former Baltimore prosecutor Ahmet Hisim. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> "It seemed like the decision was more for the appeasement of the community and now they (prosecutors) are thinking 'do we really have the evidence to prove this,' that's where they are at now," he said. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Goodson <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/what-we-know-about-the-six-baltimore-pd-officers">faces</a> second-degree "depraved heart" murder, manslaughter, assault, reckless endangerment and misconduct in office charges. </p>

                    <p> "It will be an uphill battle to convince a judge or a jury," said Douglas Colbert, a University of Maryland law professor adding that the state should focus on looking for other evidence to win. "They should look for evidence that shows Goodson was aware of Freddie Gray's dangerous health conditions or they should find other officers who were aware of the use of a 'rough rides'," he said. </p>
