<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocatio&lt;/span&gt;n">Comedian Bill Cosby won the right on Monday to delay providing evidence in a lawsuit in Massachusetts, in which he is accused of defaming women with public assertions that they fabricated sexual misconduct allegations against him.</span></p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>In his ruling, the federal judge hearing the case cited a risk Cosby might be forced to disclose facts prosecutors would use in a separate criminal case against him in Pennsylvania.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Cosby, who personified the model American family man in his long-running hit television series "The Cosby Show," was charged last year in Pennsylvania with sexually assaulting former basketball coach Andrea Constand in 2004.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>He also has been sued in civil courts in the United States by at least nine women, including seven in the case in Massachusetts.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>In that civil case, U.S. District Judge Mark Mastroianni concluded in a 13-page ruling that Cosby has a right to delay providing evidence to avoid "incriminating himself in the criminal case" by disclosing anything that may "support a conviction." </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>The decision follows a similar order last week by a California state judge who delayed Cosby's scheduled deposition and other evidence in a civil lawsuit accusing Cosby of sexually abusing a woman in 1974 when she was 15 years old.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>In the California ruling, which was seen as a precedent in other civil cases against Cosby, the judge also put on hold discovery for the plaintiff, Judy Huth.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>But the ruling on Monday from Mastroianni took a slightly different approach. The judge, citing the need to move the case forward, required the plaintiffs and third parties to provide evidence when asked by attorneys for Cosby.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Over the past two years, more than 50 women have publicly accused Cosby of rape and other sexual wrongdoing. Most involve encounters said to have occurred a decade or more ago, exceeding the statute of limitations for legal action.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Cosby, 78, is free on bail in the Pennsylvania case, which is the only criminal prosecution he faces.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><span id="midArticle_11"/><p> (Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles; editing by John Stonestreet)</p><span id="midArticle_12"/></div>
