        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Facebook Live offers streaming video in real time and was launched last year. On Wednesday, it added features, including a map of video streams around the world, expanded search, and filters that echo those on other platforms. Videos can be turned into black-and-white shots, like on Facebook's Instagram, for instance, and soon users will be able to add doodles, a nod to a feature on Snapchat.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Product head Chris Cox hosted a live video session Wednesday to advertise the product, and said Facebook hopes it will be used for everything from intimate family moments, such as a baby's first steps, celebrity-hosted question-and-answer sessions and breaking news casts. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Facebook said it is paying some partners to use Live but would not say who they are.

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told investors in January that 500 million people watch videos on Facebook every day.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><span id="midArticle_11"/><p> (Reporting by Yasmeen Abutaleb; Editing by Peter Henderson and Alistair Bell)</p><span id="midArticle_12"/></div>
