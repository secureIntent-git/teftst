   <p>Belgian Transport Minister Jacqueline Galant resigned Friday, after enduring days of criticism that became more pointed after a European Commission from last year — finding flaws in Belgian airport security — was leaked.</p>   <p>Galant's resignation comes three weeks after suicide bombers struck the Zaventem airport in Brussels, <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/03/22/471391497/what-we-know-terrorist-bombing-at-brussels-airport">in a deadly attack</a> that also included a coordinated strike at a metro station. This week, she's been accused both of failing to act on the 2015 security report and of refusing to fund stronger inspections.</p>   <p>A scandal is now boiling over how Galant handled security concerns and what she told Prime Minister Charles Michel about the European report — one of several documents that were recently leaked by federal workers and members of <a href="http://www.rtbf.be/info/belgique/detail_seance-pleniere-importante-a-la-chambre-ce-jeudi-galant-mathot-et-terrorisme?id=9269249">an opposition political party</a>.</p>   <p>From Brussels, Teri Schultz reports for our Newscast unit:</p>   <blockquote class="edTag" readability="11.5"><div readability="22">   <p>"Galant says she quit as transport minister because there had been a destructive 'crusade' against her inside her administration. Opposition politicians and members of her own staff have been releasing documents showing she received a critical European Union audit alleging 'serious deficiencies' at the Brussels airport.</p>   <p>"Galant had told Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel she had not seen such a review, and that's what he told Parliament yesterday. Announcing Galant's departure, Michel was clearly displeased.</p>   <p>"'It is unacceptable,' Michel says, that he was not informed of the June 2015 critique that said there were 'serious deficiencies' in airport security. A member of Galant's own staff warned her in a leaked memo even earlier that there were what he called 'well-known jihadists' with airport access passes."</p>   </div></blockquote>   <p>Discussing her resignation Friday, Galant – facing the media as she sat alone at a long table – said, "The orchestrated and theatrical confusion of the last 48 hours prevents me from continuing with serenity in accomplishing my tasks."</p>
