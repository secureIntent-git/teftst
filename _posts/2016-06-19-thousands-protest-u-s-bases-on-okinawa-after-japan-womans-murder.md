I want Abe to feel Okinawa's pain," said Shigenori Tsuhako, 70, who came to the event because his grand daughter is the same age as the 20-year-old murdered woman, Rina Shimabukuro.    </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The United States and Japan agreed in 1996 to close Futenma, located in a residential area, after the rape of a 12-year-old Japanese schoolgirl by three U.S. military personnel spurred mass demonstrations.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>That plan has been on hold because residents near the proposed relocation site oppose the move, worrying about noise, pollution and crime. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Okinawa assembly members against the move won a majority in the prefectural assembly election this month, providing support for Okinawa Governor Takeshi Onaga's plan to have the base move elsewhere.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Speaking to the crowd in Naha, he said he would fight to have those U.S. Marines moved off the island.    </p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Okinawa hosts 50,000 U.S. nationals, including 30,000 military personnel and civilian contractors.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The site of some of the bloodiest fighting between the U.S. and Japan in World War Two, Okinawa remained under American occupation until 1972 and around a fifth of it is still under U.S. military control. </p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Lieutenant General Lawrence D. Nicholson, commander of the U.S. Marines there, told Reuters on Saturday that Washington may be able to return a 10,000 acre (40.5 square km) tract of jungle early next year, which would be the biggest hand back since 1972.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Yet, with the United States and Japan looking to contain China's growing might in the East China Sea, the Okinawan island chain, stretching close to Taiwan, is becoming strategically more valuable to military planners.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Japan's Self Defence Force, which is pivoting away from defending its northern borders, is fortifying the region with radar bases and anti-ship missile batteries.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Last month's arrest of the U.S. civilian worker prompted the U.S. military to announce a 30-day period of mourning for the victim and restrict off-base drinking in a bid to assuage local anger.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>But relations frayed further with the subsequent arrest of a U.S. sailor on Okinawa on suspicion of drunk driving following a car crash.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>"All U.S. bases in Japan should close. I want Abe to listen to what the people in Okinawa are saying," said Ryoko Shimabukuro, a 28-year-old government worker at the protest.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><span id="midArticle_1"/><p> (Additional reporting by Teppei Kasai; Editing by Linda Sieg and Kim Coghill)</p><span id="midArticle_2"/></div>
