<p>Is there any less satisfying TV-going experience than watching <em>Broad City </em>alone? After all, this is a show that, in just two short seasons, turned stars and co-creators Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson into “Ilana and Abbi” —a two-headed, high-as-balls hydra whose unflagging devotion and, <em>yasss</em>, secret syntax make for one of the most enviable prime-time friendships since Cliff and Norm. They are relatably ride-or-die-style pals—the kind you only find once or twice IRL— which may be why <em>Broad City</em> is best experienced with your own Ilana or Abbi on-hand.</p>
<p>So you’ll want to make some space on the couch for rewatching last night’s stseason-three premiere, “2 Chainz,” as it’s one of the series’ most enjoyably breezy yet: A shaggy-dog tale that finds Ilana and Abbi traversing New York City in search of a bathroom, and finding instead a never-ending array of weirdos, from porn-watching truck-drivers to brawling sample-sale shoppers to dong-obsessed artists.</p>
<p><em>Broad City </em>has always depicted New York as a city of surreal terrors—a land in which the simple task of retrieving a package leads to <a href="http://www.cc.com/video-clips/ag4wvb/broad-city-north-brother-island" target="_blank">an outer-borough exodus</a>, and where the Upper East Side is revealed as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WG1-GSubR98" target="_blank">a vapid, wealth-strewn wasteland</a>. But the hilariously elaborate “Chainz” is an ambitious, full-on downtown-fantasia, one that recalls Martin Scorsese’s 1985 boho-horror comedy <em>After Hours.</em> It turns New York into a recognizably alien planet, and casts Ilana and Abbi as both its bemused visitors, and its eventual conquerors (it also features references to DMX, Hillary Clinton’s <em>Living History</em>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0k7rKsCiLg" target="_blank">1998 Grammy-disruptor Soy Bomb</a>—all testaments to the show’s pop-culture prowess).</p>
<figure attachment_1976353="" class="wp-caption landscape alignnone fader relative" data-js="fader"><a href="http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/broads_3.jpg"><img class="size-default-top-art wp-image-1976353" src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Your-BFFs-Are-Back-in-Broad-Citys-New-Season.jpg" alt="broads_3.jpg" width="582" height="437"/></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text link-underline"><span class="credit link-underline-sm"><span aria-hidden="true" class="ui ui ui-photo inline-block ui-credit relative opacity-5 marg-r-micro"/> Comedy Central</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the surface, “Chainz”, like many of the best <em>Broad City </em>installments, seems both cozily shambolic and decidedly low-stakes. But those who confuse the series’ bong-borne, granular observations of everyday city living as mere stoners’ digressions—or who can’t decipher the show’s happily elastic tone—aren’t watching closely enough. In the years since it began as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDXmMI6u2lU" target="_blank">likably low-key web series</a>, <em>Broad City </em>has matured into one of the most experimental comedies on TV, a safe space for all sorts of logical lunacy, from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tDN5DYsNk0" target="_blank">mini-music videos</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZlqFki69Uc" target="_blank">Lynch-like character switcheroos</a>. The early episodes of Season Three keep that gonzo vibe intact: There’s a local food coop that’s slowly revealed to be a Scientology-style cult, and an out-of-nowhere song-and-dance sequence in which an Oscar winner re-inhabits one of her most famous big-screen characters (no spoilers here).</p>
<p>Yet the center of all of this remains the relationship between Ilana and Abbi, whose steadfast, vape-assisted allegiance keeps <em>Broad </em>grounded. At one point in the season premiere, Ilana—after being rescued by Abbi from the back of a truck—blurts out “let’s get married!” then quickly backtracks. It’s a nod, of course, to Ilana’s not-so-secret desires toward her friend. But it’s also an affectionate ode to their ever-deepening bond, and a charming reminder that, for all its fizzy weirdness, <em>Broad City</em>’s finest moments are when it simply focuses on its two best buds.</p>
