<br><div id="start-of-content"><article class="content link-underline relative body-copy" data-js="content" itemprop="articleBody" readability="41.003448275862"><p><em>On the </em>Song Exploder<em> podcast, host Hrishikesh Hirway talks to musicians who take apart their songs and, piece by piece, tell the stories of how they were made. Listen below.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.andrewbird.net/" target="_blank">Andrew Bird</a> is a singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist, perhaps known best for his violin playing and his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrkIxTYymyE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1m50s" target="_blank">whistling</a>. In this episode, Bird breaks down his song “Roma Fade,” from the 2016 album <em>Are You Serious?</em> It’s about the moment when he first saw his wife, Katherine Tsina, at an after-show party at the Beacon Theater in Los Angeles. He describes how the lyrics reflect his experience of that night, and he talks about how he collaborated with producer Tony Berg, the first time he’s relied heavily on a producer during recording sessions for an album.</p>
