Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims to parts of the waters, through which about $5 trillion in trade is shipped every year.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>"Countries across the Asia-Pacific are voicing concern with China’s land reclamation, which stands out in size and scope, as</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>

"They’re voicing those concerns publicly and</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>privately, at the highest levels, in regional meetings, and global fora."</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>The Philippines has disputed China's claims in a case it has brought before an international arbitration court.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>A contingent of U.S. military aircraft and 200 U.S. airmen from U.S. Pacific Air Forces would be at Clark Air Base, a former U.S. Air Force base, through the end of the month, Carter said.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>A U.S. defense official said the U.S. expected there would be additional follow-on rotations of aircraft. The aircraft in the initial contingent include five A-10C Thunderbolt II ground attack aircraft, three HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters, and a MC-130H special operations aircraft.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>In addition, up to 75 U.S. troops, mostly Marines, would remain in the Philippines "on a rotational basis" after the conclusion of joint "Balikatan" U.S.-Philippines military exercises this week. The troops would support "increased operations in the region," the Pentagon said.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>The left-wing Bayan (Nation), an umbrella group of Philippine nationalist and anti-U.S. organizations, dismissed such cooperation with the United States as a move by the U.S. military to create a permanent presence in the Philippines as a platform from which it could dominate the region.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>"Our dispute with China can never be used as a reason to allow another country to violate our sovereignty," its secretary-general, Renato Reyes, said in a statement, in apparent reference to the 2014 Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement that grants Washington an increased military presence in the Philippines.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>"It cannot be used to justify the return of U.S. bases, under a questionable and open-ended agreement."</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><span id="midArticle_15"/><p> (Reporting by Yeganeh Torbati; Editing by Nick Macfie)</p><span id="midArticle_16"/></div>
