And if it breaks up NATO, it breaks up NATO," Trump said.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Trump has frequently criticized NATO in recent weeks as the race for the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 election has heated up.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>At a campaign stop in Wausau, Wisconsin on Saturday, Trump expressed concerns over the United States' relationship with oil-rich Saudi Arabia, which Trump accused of not pitching in fair pay for U.S. defense.    </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>"We take care of Saudi Arabia. Now nobody’s going to mess with Saudi Arabia because we’re watching them," he said. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
