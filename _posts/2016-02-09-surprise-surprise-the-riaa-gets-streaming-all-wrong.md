<br><div id=""><p>Platinum status has been <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/11/adele-record-setting-sales/" target="_blank">pretty elusive lately</a>, mostly because it’s hard to sell a million albums to people who aren’t buying albums anymore. When the Recording Industry Association of America tweaked its gold and platinum certification process last week, though, seemingly everyone became a platinum artist.</p>
<p>To get with the times, the RIAA now counts audio and visual streaming numbers toward an artist’s total album sales. Grab a pencil: now 1,500 streams = 10 track downloads = one album purchase. Due to the change, a ton of artists saw their albums go gold or platinum overnight: Kendrick Lamar, Big Sean, Shawn Mendes, Miranda Lambert, Hozier, and more crossed into the million-copy club. (Don’t worry, if your favorite artist isn’t on the list, all you have to do is stream their tracks 1.5 billion times!)</p>
<p>The good news is you and your Spotify habit may no longer be an obstacle to an artist’s success. The bad news, though, is the new system sets up a world in which streaming is both default and devalued. Rather than choose between two sides—placating artists by coming out against streaming, or embracing streaming as the will of the people—the RIAA has chosen to stake out a middle ground that’s a solution for neither, and an affront to both.</p>
<h3>Precious Metals</h3>
<p>The music industry has generally responded positively to the change, though Anthony “Top Dawg” Tiffith, CEO of Top Dawg Entertainment, tweeted that he (and presumably Kendrick Lamar) aren’t even acknowledging <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em> as platinum until actual money changes hands.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" readability="9.8564356435644">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">we don’t stand behind this <a href="https://twitter.com/RIAA">@RIAA</a> bs. ole skool rules apply, 1 million albums sold is platinum.until we reach that #, save all the congrats.</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum is Nicki Minaj, who maintains that her streaming numbers should have earned <em>The Pinkprint</em> triple platinum by now, and if her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/_VrDkDL8TH/" target="_blank"> Instagram posts</a> are to be believed, she’s willing to go to court to get that fixed. There’s no question that going platinum is important for artists. In an email to WIRED, Liz Kennedy Holman, director of the RIAA’s Gold &amp; Platinum Program, likened it to artists “earning their entry into an exclusive club.” But we all know that this is about more than qualifying to own a shiny plaque. “The natural way of things is that it’s a good promotional tool,” said Jay Cooper, a Los Angeles lawyer who has represented artists like Katy Perry. “The fact that it’s gone platinum means that the public accepts it. And if people see that the public accepts it, more people are going to say, ‘Hey, maybe I should buy that.'” So, given that the RIAA is—or tries to be—a consumption-driven barometer of public opinion, it’s appropriate for them to update their process to reflect current habits. And Holman was quick to draw our attention to this “organic tweet” from Iggy Azalea: </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" readability="8.4472049689441"><p>
<a href="https://twitter.com/sighzach">@sighzach</a> no. thats how music is being consumed, the world did it. RIAA is just reacting to how ppl consume music.</p>
<p>— IGGY AZALEA (@IGGYAZALEA) <a href="https://twitter.com/IGGYAZALEA/status/695474677947338752">February 5, 2016</a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>But more significantly, this rules change is also a move toward legitimizing streaming.</p>
<h3>Islands in the Stream</h3>
<p>Obviously, we’ve all been streaming for a while. But despite Spotify having brought the business model to the US nearly five years ago, artists have long complained (Looking at you, T-Swift. And you, <a href="https://thetrichordist.com/2013/06/24/my-song-got-played-on-pandora-1-million-times-and-all-i-got-was-16-89-less-than-what-i-make-from-a-single-t-shirt-sale/" target="_blank">David Lowery</a>.) that they’re not seeing enough buck for their streaming bang, which still remains a concern.</p>
<p>“The real question is, will [the rules change] have any impact on the flow of royalties to artists,” says attorney Lisa Alter, who specializes in music copyright law at New York firm Alter, Kendrick &amp; Baron. “Hopefully, it will focus attention on how much music is being streamed, and how the money really flows … I’ve been involved in record label audits where it was difficult for even the most experienced auditors to say what and why artists are being paid.”</p>
<p>It’s no real mystery why TDE isn’t feeling the RIAA’s change of tune: the old school was far more lucrative for artists. That monetary difference between physical album sales (or even downloads) and streaming is the only reason to oppose it, and TDE has been roundly called out for its stance.</p>
<p>“The Kendrick Lamars, the Taylor Swifts … those people can afford to say no,” Kenneth Abdo, an entertainment lawyer whose Minnesota-based practice deals with emerging artists who don’t have that luxury. Indie musicians <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/06/indie-musicians-apple-music-better-myspace/" target="_blank">cling to streaming</a> despite the fact that it doesn’t pay the bills, in hopes of being discovered and breaking big. “It’s a Catch-22,” Abdo says.</p>
<p>This RIAA rules change hasn’t made the situation less ambiguous, either. Certainly figuring streaming data into one of the most recognized metrics of success is a nod in streaming’s favor, a sign of acceptance that it’s not going anywhere. But this is where we have to call shenanigans. The RIAA’s ratio (1,500 streams = 10 track downloads = 1 album purchase) is a clear indication they think streaming is a lesser form of listening—and that’s where the trouble lies.</p>
<h3>Second-Class Streams</h3>
<p>If you don’t subscribe to a streaming service, you have to pay to listen to an album even once. Can you imagine if had to listen to an album 100, 150 times through for it to count as officially purchased? That’s pretty unrealistic, and not only because it’s a 60-hour commitment.</p>
<p>If the RIAA’s claim to relevance here is that it is rewarding the music we appreciate by measuring how much we consume it, it should follow that one physical album listen = one streaming listen. (Though, if we’re going to really make this shift, streaming services need to be paying songwriters accordingly. <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/11/aloe-blacc-pay-songwriters/" target="_blank">Just ask Aloe Blacc</a>. Or <a href="https://thetrichordist.com/2013/06/24/my-song-got-played-on-pandora-1-million-times-and-all-i-got-was-16-89-less-than-what-i-make-from-a-single-t-shirt-sale/" target="_blank">Lowery</a>.)</p>
<p>What they have now relegates streaming to a second tier. Which ultimately might be fine and even correct. After all, there’s another kind of populist, ad-supported music service that the RIAA has never taken into account: the radio. The radio isn’t a platform artists have traditionally expected to make millions from. Like streaming, it feels social and trend-driven. It’s not as serious a commitment as buying an album. And there have probably always been people who enjoy hearing songs on the radio (or choosing them on the jukebox) but don’t then go on to buy the album.</p>
<p>So it’s hard to say if the situation streaming has created for the music industry is totally new, or just another version of the status quo. But the RIAA had the opportunity to throw its weight around here, and instead pulled its punch. Either streaming is the new platform to rule them all—and considering how we’re shifting from an ownership-driven culture to an access-driven culture, that seems about right—or it’s the new radio. What it can’t be is both, and that’s where the RIAA decision leaves it.</p>
