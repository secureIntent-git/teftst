        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Prominent Republicans this week distanced themselves from Trump's comments about Muslims after the Orlando mass shooting. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday he did not think a ban on Muslim immigrants was in U.S. interests. U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who ran against Trump for the Republican nomination and has been a fierce critic since, said Trump's response made him "unnerved."</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, said on Wednesday that Trump's rhetoric had grown "even more inflammatory" in recent days. She said the United States counts on partners in majority-Muslim countries to help fight terrorism.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>

He also said radical Muslims were entering the country amidst a flood of refugees and "trying to take over our children."</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Trump previously has drawn criticism, including from within his own party, for saying he would implement a database to keep track of Muslims in the United States and require them to register.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Trump's hard-line proposals on immigration have contributed to his popularity among some conservative voters. But they have also triggered condemnation from minority and human rights activists, and his political opponents, many of whom have called his rhetoric racist.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><span id="midArticle_14"/><p> (Reporting by Emily Stephenson and Amanda Becker; Editing by Will Dunham)</p><span id="midArticle_15"/></div>
