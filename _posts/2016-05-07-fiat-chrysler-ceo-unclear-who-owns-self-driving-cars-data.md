<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="6"><p><span class="articleLocation">WINDSOR, Ont.</span> Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (<span id="symbol_FCHA.MI_0">FCHA.MI</span>) (<span id="symbol_FCAU.N_1">FCAU.N</span>) and Alphabet Inc's (<span id="symbol_GOOGL.O_2">GOOGL.O</span>) Google have yet to determine who would own data collected in their collaboration on self-driving vehicles, FCA Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said Friday.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>"That's exactly what has to be determined," Marchionne said in response to a reporter's question on data ownership. "We need to get to a stage where the car is viable so we can discuss the spoils of that work. We're not there."</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Earlier this week, FCA and Google announced they agreed to fit Google's self-driving technology into 100 Chrysler Pacifica minivans, marking the first time a Silicon Valley firm has teamed up with a traditional carmaker to develop an autonomous vehicle.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Marchionne said there are many aspects of the project with Google that have yet to be determined, such as whether the two will develop an open-source software platform that could be shared with others.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Marchionne said what has been agreed so far with Google is limited, but he suggested that the alliance could evolve.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"The objective of this first phase of our collaboration is very targeted," Marchionne said at a news conference at FCA's Windsor plant. "It's designed to take Google technology into the minivan. It's very, very focused. It has a very clear objective and a very clear timeline. What develops from here, we'll see."</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Google declined to comment.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Marchionne said FCA has been purposely restrained in comparison with other automakers that have bought Silicon Valley companies to speed development of self-driving vehicles.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Lack of clarity over the question of who owns data in a collaboration with Google is one of the reasons most big automakers have refrained from tying up with the Silicon Valley giant.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>"It's too early in this process to try and make the call about who is going to end up with sort of the winning solution," Marchionne said.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Marchionne said he has noticed "efforts by others to pre-empt what I consider to be a natural evolution of choices and so making unequivocal bets with companies who are in that space today, and effectively precluding the development with others is a very dangerous bet."</p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Marchionne did not name those companies.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>In March, General Motors Co (<span id="symbol_GM.N_3">GM.N</span>) agreed to acquire San Francisco self-driving car startup Cruise Automation. Daimler AG (<span id="symbol_DAIGn.DE_4">DAIGn.DE</span>), BMW (<span id="symbol_BMWG.DE_5">BMWG.DE</span>) and Volkswagen AG (<span id="symbol_VOWG_p.DE_6">VOWG_p.DE</span>) last year bought digital mapping company HERE to accelerate their autonomous driving development.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>This week, Ford Motor Co (<span id="symbol_F.N_7">F.N</span>) said it would invest $182  million in San Francisco-based Pivotal Software, to boost Ford's software capabilities.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><span id="midArticle_15"/><p> (Reporting by Bernie Woodall; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Richard Chang)</p><span id="midArticle_16"/></div>
