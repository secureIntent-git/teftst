        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The show - a mix of on-stage theatrics, speeches and under-cover reports - last year singled out Volkswagen, Nissan Motor Co and Daimler AG's Mercedes Benz, accusing them of selling spare parts and services customers didn't need.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>The CCTV program has, however, been losing some of its bite, with some viewers jumping to defend targeted companies and younger audiences simply switching channel.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>A Reuters analysis of posts on China's popular Sina Weibo microblog mentioning "315", the common name for the show referring to the date of World Consumer Rights Day, shows a big drop in online chatter about the program since 2014.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
