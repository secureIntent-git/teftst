<span class="focusParagraph" readability="2"><p>(Adds statement from government spokesman)</p></span><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>By Ragnhildur Sigurdardottir</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p><span class="articleLocation">REYKJAVIK, April 5</span> Iceland's Prime Minister
Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson became the first major casualty of
the Panama Papers revelations, stepping down on Tuesday after
leaked files showed his wife owned an offshore firm with big
claims on the country's collapsed banks.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The ruling Progressive Party's deputy leader, Sigurdur Ingi
Johannsson, who holds the fisheries and agriculture portfolio,
told reporters Gunnlaugsson was stepping down and that the party
had proposed to their junior coalition partner, the Independence
Party, that he become the new prime minister himself.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The two parties discussed the matter on Tuesday evening but
no agreement was reached. Talks are expected to continue.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The leaked documents from a Panamanian law firm that
specialises in setting up offshore companies have shone a light
on the finances of politicians and public figures from around
the world, causing public outrage over how the powerful are able
to hide money and avoid tax.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Adding confusion to the political crisis, a statement
emailed on Tuesday night by government spokesman Sigurdur
Jonsson said Gunnlaugsson had suggested that Johannsson take
over as prime minister "for an unspecified amount of time".</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>"The prime minister has not resigned and will continue to
serve as chairman of the Progressive Party," it said.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>An Iceland government spokesman has said the claims against
Iceland's collapsed banks held by the firm owned by the prime
minister's wife - in which he also temporarily held a stake -
totalled more than 500 million Icelandic crowns ($4.1 million).
Gunnlaugson has said his wife's assets were taxed in Iceland.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>His decision to step down came after thousands of Icelanders
gathered in front of parliament on Monday, hurling eggs and
bananas and demanding the departure of the leader of the
centre-right coalition government, which has been in power since
2013.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Opposition politicians, pushing for fresh general elections,
also filed a motion of no-confidence in Gunnlaugson and the
government on Monday. The parliamentary vote could still take
place this week and could trigger elections if the motion is
carried.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>"It is clear our demand for new elections still stands,"
Left Green Party leader Katr√≠n Jakobsdottir told Reuters.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>But Finance Minister Bjarni Benediktsson, from the
Independence party, the junior partner in the coalition
government which has absolute majority in parliament, said he
hoped the coalition would continue.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>"We have agreed to start talks with the Progressive Party
and to try to continue the co-operation we have had and which
has until now been very fruitful for the Icelandic nation," he
told Reuters.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Any new election could see victory for the
anti-establishment Pirate Party, according to polls the most
popular political force in Iceland, which espouses grassroots
democracy and transparency.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Gunnlaugsson's opponents say he should have been open about
the overseas assets and the company, and that he had a conflict
of interest because the government is involved in striking deals
with claimants against the bankrupt banks.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>Iceland's main commercial banks collapsed as the global
financial crisis hit in 2008 and many Icelanders have blamed the
North Atlantic island nation's politicians for not reining in
the banks' debt-fuelled binge and averting a deep recession.
