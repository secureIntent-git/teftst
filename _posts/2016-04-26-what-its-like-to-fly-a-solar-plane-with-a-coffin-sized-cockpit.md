<br><div id="start-of-content"><p>This month, <a href="http://www.wired.com/tag/solar-impulse"><em>Solar Impulse 2</em></a>, the sun-powered airplane that’s flying around the world, finally made it to the American mainland. Four days after pilot Bertrand Piccard <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/04/long-delay-solar-impulse-2-ready-finish-round-world-flight/">climbed into the coffin-sized cockpit</a> and took off from Hawaii, he landed at Moffett Field, in California’s Bay Area.</p>
<p>WIRED caught up with Piccard and his co-pilot, André Borschberg (they take turns flying) in Silicon Valley. We took a closer look at the plane with the wings of a jumbojet and the weight of a car, including the tightest cockpit we’ve ever seen—with a toilet built into the seat. </p>
<p>Piccard and Borschberg explain how they stay sane while aloft, why they’re doing this, and their hopes for the role of the sun in the future of aviation. </p>
