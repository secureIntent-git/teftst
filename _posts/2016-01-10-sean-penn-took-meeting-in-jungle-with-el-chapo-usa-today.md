When it ended hours later, Penn had a scoop and the possible script for a different movie: Call it <em>Sean and Shorty</em>.</p><p>"I take no pride in keeping secrets that may be perceived as protecting criminals, nor do I have any gloating arrogance at posing for selfies with unknowing security men," Penn writes. "But...this will be the first interview El Chapo had ever granted outside an interrogation room, leaving me no precedent by which to measure the hazards."</p><p>Penn says Guzmán agreed to a meeting because he wanted some Hollywood <em>jefe</em> to make a movie about his lucrative life of drug-dealing, which also includes mass murder, torture and power-grabbing in Mexico. As he he tells Penn, he "supplies more heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana than anybody else in the world."</p><div id="module-position-OuB3VzYyvfs" class="story-asset oembed-asset"><div class="story-oembed-wrap "><div class="js-oembed story-oembed story-oembed-twitter story-oembed-type-rich" data-oembed-type="rich" data-oembed-provider="twitter" readability="20.936170212766"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" readability="4.5797872340426"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Watch two minutes of El Chapo's first-ever interview, taped shortly before his recapture <a href="https://t.co/BxzdjvMEi8">https://t.co/BxzdjvMEi8</a><a href="https://t.co/YSptWfKklW">pic.twitter.com/YSptWfKklW</a></p>— Rolling Stone (@RollingStone) <a href="https://twitter.com/RollingStone/status/686215351219138561">January 10, 2016</a></blockquote></div></div></div><p>So, with some Hollywood producer-types that Penn only semi-identifies, plus a Mexican soap-opera star, Kate del Castillo, to broker the introduction (she was the "ticket to El Chapo's trust," Penn writes), he set off late last year on a long, secret trip to an unnamed area of northern Mexico to meet El Chapo and interview him for a possible bio pic while surrounded by platoons of the drug lord's men armed to the teeth and edgy.</p><div id="module-position-OuB3VzbPzgY" class="story-asset image-asset" readability="34"><aside itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="wide single-photo" readability="8"><img itemprop="url" src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1452450880_497_Sean-Penn-took-meeting-in-jungle-with-039El-Chapo039-USA-TODAY.jpg" alt="Sean Penn's article in 'Rolling Stone' about his meeting" width="540" height="405" data-mycapture-src="" data-mycapture-sm-src=""/><meta itemprop="name" content="Sean Penn article in Rolling Stone"/><meta itemprop="height" content="405"/><meta itemprop="width" content="540"/><p>Sean Penn's article in 'Rolling Stone' about his meeting with drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman shows on the magazine's website, in Mexico City, on January 10, 2016.<meta itemprop="copyrightHolder" content="Alfredo Estrella, AFP/Getty Images"/> <span class="credit">(Photo: Alfredo Estrella, AFP/Getty Images)</span></p></aside></div><p>"Had we really just been where we were? With whom we'd been?," Penn writes towards the end of his article, once he's back in Los Angeles. "It seemed such a strange dream. Somehow, with all the planning and the travel, I still hadn't believed that we'd actually gotten to El Chapo. I'd imagined us arriving to a gentle apology, that for some unexplained security reason the visit could not take place, and we'd be going home to Los Angeles empty-handed. But that's not what happened."</p><p>Penn's article landed with a bang because it came just a day after Guzmán, until then the world's most wanted drug lord, was recaptured for the second time in his home state of Sinaloa, next door to Durango state where Mexican officials say the Penn-El Chapo meeting took place.</p><p>On Friday, Mexican Attorney General Arely Gomez said that Guzmán's interview with Penn helped give law enforcement a lead on tracking and capturing El Chapo, after leading authorities to Guzmán in a rural part of Durango in October.</p><p>AFP reported Sunday that authorities in Mexico now want to talk to Penn and del Castillo about their meeting with El Chapo.</p><p>Penn, through his publicist Mara Buxbaum, declined Sunday to comment on his role, if any, in the recapture of El Chapo. Nor would he comment on the media and legal furor his article caused, and whether he could be in danger — from the Sinaloa cartel or from Mexican or American law enforcement — as a result of his tete a tete with Guzmán.</p><p>And Penn said little Saturday night at his Help Haiti Home charity gala in Beverly Hills, where he arrived holding hands with ex-wife Madonna, according to <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/6836451/madonna-sean-penn-help-haiti-home-fundraiser-el-chapo-rolling-stone?utm_source=twitter"><em>Billboard</em></a> magazine.</p><div id="module-position-OuB3VzbtAxQ" class="story-asset oembed-asset"><div class="story-oembed-wrap "><div class="js-oembed story-oembed story-oembed-twitter story-oembed-type-rich" data-oembed-type="rich" data-oembed-provider="twitter" readability="15.754098360656"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" readability="2.5409836065574"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ballerz ??Hope For Haiti <a href="https://twitter.com/jphro">@jphro</a> ❤️ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rebelhearts?src=hash">#rebelhearts</a><a href="https://t.co/g83ADwQZx7">pic.twitter.com/g83ADwQZx7</a></p>— Madonna (@Madonna) <a href="https://twitter.com/Madonna/status/686171536403906560">January 10, 2016</a></blockquote></div></div></div><p>But in his article he said that there were already indications back in October, shortly after the jungle meeting, that law enforcement was getting close to El Chapo's hiding place.</p><p>"Evidently, El Chapo and his men, after leaving us the night before, had skirted through the jungle back to a ranch property," he wrote. "According to media reports that didn't come until days later, a cellphone among his crew had been tracked."</p><p>Authorities later raided the area but decided not to open fire on Guzmán as he ran away because he was with two women and child. He escaped, but authorities finally caught him Friday at a house in Los Mochis, Sinaloa, where Mexican marines grabbed him after a shootout that left five people dead.</p><p>Penn has landed in news headlines before. He has publicly intervened to help victims of Hurricane Katrina, the 2010 Haiti earthquake and survivors of 2012 floods in Pakistan. He has campaigned for same-sex marriage and defended the late Venezuela president Hugo Chavez, who was known for his anti-American rhetoric.</p><p>In the rather baroque prose of his article, he rails against the "failed" American war on drugs by "our puritanical and prosecutorial culture" that has cost billions, killed children, drained economies and overwhelmed police and prisons. He presents his views as one of the reasons why he sought to interview El Chapo.</p><p>"As an American citizen, I'm drawn to explore what may be inconsistent with the portrayals our government and media brand upon their declared enemies," Penn acknowledges. "Not since Osama bin Laden has the pursuit of a fugitive so occupied the public imagination."</p><p>Penn's article has drawn media criticism in part because <em>Rolling Stone</em> (already damaged by a failed story about alleged rape at the University of Virginia) acknowledged in an editor's note that the piece was submitted to Guzmán for approval before publication, which is generally considered a no-no in journalism. El Chapo did not demand any changes, the magazine said. (He does not speak or read English, as Penn's article made clear; del Castillo had to do all the translating.)</p><p>Did Penn and companions break some law in either the U.S. or Mexico with their escapade? Not clear but CNN media-and-legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said on CNN's <em>Reliable Sources</em> Sunday that he did not believe there would be legal consequences for Penn.</p><p>Toobin said journalists interview fugitives and accused criminals all the time; in fact, Osama bin Laden was interviewed by journalists while he was hiding out before he was killed by U.S. forces in Pakistan in 2011.</p><div id="module-position-OuB3VzawNLc" class="story-asset oembed-asset"><div class="story-oembed-wrap "><div class="js-oembed story-oembed story-oembed-twitter story-oembed-type-rich" data-oembed-type="rich" data-oembed-provider="twitter" readability="26.526315789474"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" readability="5.0526315789474"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/JeffreyToobin">@JeffreyToobin</a> - "I would have interviewed him.
