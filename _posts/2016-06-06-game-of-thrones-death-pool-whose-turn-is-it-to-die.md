					<p>If <em>Game of Thrones</em> has taught us anything, it’s that the true survivors are the ones with the intangibles. Tyrion Lannister’s swagger has saved his bacon more than once; Petyr Baelish’s silver tongue is pretty much the only thing that keeps him from meeting the working end of a Moon Door. But looking at the betting odds for tonight’s episode, it’s pretty clear that while intangibles help, the ones getting out alive will have very real assets on their side. Got dragons? Or maybe a trusty sword named Needle? You’re safe! That said, if you have yourself a Faith Militant troupe or a little thing called Greyscale, it might be time to review your life insurance policy. </p>
