Buffett has criticized tax policies that allow the rich to pay lower rates than the middle class.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"I want to go further and impose what I call a fair share surcharge on multi-millionaires because right now, we’re behind and we need to get the wealthy and the corporations to pay for their fair share, so I can keep my promise, which is I will not raise taxes on the middle class," Clinton said at a campaign stop in Iowa on Monday.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
