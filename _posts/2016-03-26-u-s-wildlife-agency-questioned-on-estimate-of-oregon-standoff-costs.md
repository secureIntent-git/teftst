<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocatio&lt;/span&gt;n">An attorney for a leader of the recent 41-day armed protest at a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon on Saturday questioned the $6 million price tag cited by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for dealing with the occupation.</span></p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>U.S. Fish and Wildlife director Dan Ashe said at a news conference in Oregon on Wednesday those costs included $1.7 million for restoration of the refuge near Burns and increased law enforcement patrols elsewhere after the six-week occupation, which ended on Feb. 11.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>In response, Michael Arnold, an attorney for protest leader Ammon Bundy who faces conspiracy and weapons charges in connection with the occupation, said the government should not use the protest as a blank check for unwarranted expenses.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"This protest should not be a government expenditure lottery ticket," Arnold said. "I've only heard of one wall damaged in the whole set of buildings."</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The protest marked the latest flare-up in the so-called Sagebrush Rebellion, a decades-old conflict over federal control of millions of acres in the West.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>U.S. Fish and Wildlife spokesman Gavin Shire said on Saturday, in response to Arnold's contentions, the agency's figures include a "range of damages," from roads and trenches created by the occupiers to the harm inflicted on sacred American Indian artifacts.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>"The amount does not address – as no dollar figure can – the emotional harm that service staff and their families suffered as a result of the hostile takeover," Shire said.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>The agency had to relocate 17 employees from the center, when those workers moved with their families to major cities because of threats against them, Ashe said earlier this week.    </p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>U.S. Fish and Wildlife also spent $2.5 million to station more law enforcement officers at its Western facilities, because it feared anti-government protest could spread beyond eastern Oregon where armed activists staged their occupation, Ashe said.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>That represented the largest share of the more than $6 million spent by the agency, Ashe said. </p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Oregon lawmakers this month voted to set aside $2 million for Harney County, the location of the protest, to reimburse it for police overtime and other costs if the federal government does not underwrite those expenses.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation, which headed a law enforcement operation to encircle and arrest several of the anti-government protesters, has not released its expenditures from the occupation.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>More than 25 participants in the protest have been charged in federal court.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><span id="midArticle_14"/><p> (Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles; Editing by Bill Trott and James Dalgleish)</p><span id="midArticle_15"/></div>
