And in Houston on Wednesday, a brawl involving several adults broke out over a parking space at the Houston Zoo.</p><p>While the circumstances and motive surrounding Smith's death are not yet firmly established, the problem of road rage is clear-cut and on the rise.</p><p>National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data, based on police reports, shows road rage or aggressive driving were reported as factors in 375 fatal crashes resulting in 418 deaths in 2014. In 2009, road rage or aggressive driving was reported as a contributing factor in 196 fatal crashes resulting in 235 fatalities. The numbers do not include violence after the crash.</p><p>Jeff Asher, a crime data consultant based in New Orleans, said Sunday there are no firm statistics on road rage. But he said curbing the problem has more to do with psychology than driving skills.</p><p>"It's about conflict resolution," Asher told USA TODAY. "It starts in childhood, with education. Teaching people to resolve their conflicts peacefully."</p><p>In New Orleans, Smith and his wife were traveling in their Mercedes when they were hit by a Hummer H2 driven by Cardell Hayes, police said. The two men "exchanged words," the statement said, then Hayes fatally shot Smith and wounded Smith's wife.</p><p>Helen Cameron, a senior fellow at the University of South Australia’s School of Psychology, said men between the ages of 16 to 40 are the most likely drivers to succumb to anger while driving — the same group most likely to commit any other violent act.</p><p>“It’s part of socialization and it’s something we as a society have never learned to deal with," she recently told Australia's <a href="http://www.news.com.au/national/crime/the-psychology-of-a-road-rager-experts-reveals-what-makes-us-snap/news-story/2107a591ceaa4c7db707e081b288392d">news.com</a>.
