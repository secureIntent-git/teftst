<p>Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill said Monday she has breast cancer and would remain in St. Louis for the next three weeks to receive treatment. The Democrat said in a blog post Monday that the cancer was detected through a regular mammogram. "It's a little scary, but my prognosis is good and I expect a full recovery," she said. McCaskill, 62, said she will post on her Senate website how she would have voted on any matters that come before the Senate. She said she will also submit questions that could be asked at hearings.</p>
<p>Study: china's air beats india's</p>
<p>It's a never-ending debate in Asia — whose air quality is worse, China's or India's? A new study by Greenpeace released Monday is trying to answer that question. Analysts looked at NASA satellite images and found that measurements of particulate matter — the microscopic particles that invade your lungs and can cause cancer and heart disease — improved impressively in China over the past few years but worsened in India. Greenpeace said the average Indian citizen was exposed to more particulate matter than the average Chinese.</p>
<p>America's favorite Dog breed: Labs </p>
<p>Labrador retrievers still reign supreme after a quarter century as America's most prevalent purebred dog, according to the American Kennel Club, which released its annual breed rankings Monday. German shepherds, golden retrievers, bulldogs and beagles fill out the top five. After that come French bulldogs, Yorkshire terriers, poodles, Rottweilers and boxers. Club vice president Gina DiNardo said the list shows Americans "like easy-to-care-for, fun, family dogs," whether big or small.</p>

The plate was approved in June 2015.</p>
