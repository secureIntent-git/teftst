<br><div id=""><p>About a month ago, <a href="http://www.wired.com/tag/vizio/">Vizio</a> announced its new <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/03/vizio-p-series-hdr/">high-end P-series TVs</a>. Even for the historically budget-minded brand, those new TVs represented crazy bang for the buck: <a href="http://www.wired.com/tag/4k/">4K</a> panels with <a href="http://www.wired.com/tag/hdr/">HDR</a> capabilities, full-array backlighting with local dimming to boost contrast, unique tablet-style remotes and Chromecasting features, and prices starting at $1,000. It turns out the P series was a sign of things to come, as the company has expanded its cost-efficient 2016 lineup. Vizio’s new M-series and E-series TVs offer similar features for even lower prices.</p>
<p>For <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/04/new-vizio-tvs/">the second year in a row</a>, Vizio’s M series looks to offer gobs of performance for a low price. Starting at just $850 for a 50-inch panel, the midrange (thus “M”) television line offers most of what the high-end P series does for less money.</p>

</p>
Each set in the M line is a 4K panel capable of displaying <a href="http://www.wired.com/tag/dolby/">Dolby Vision</a> HDR content. Along with a traditional remote, the M series panels come with a similar 6-inch Android tablet as the P-series TVs. You use the tablet to cast streaming content to the set, as there’s no app ecosystem on the TV itself. You can also use your own phone or tablet for those casting features. Vizio has its own SmartCast app for controlling deeper settings on each set and searching for shows across streaming providers. 
<p>The M series also has local-dimming features, but there’s a major difference between these lower-priced TVs and the top-tier P-series lineup. While the P series offers up to 128 local-dimming zones—which translates to more granular contrast controls—the M series sets top out at 64 zones. The M series doesn’t get as bright as the P series (400 nits versus 600 nits), it doesn’t have the same color gamut, and its included tablet has lesser specs.</p>
<p>Still, for a TV with these features, the pricing is completely bananas. There’s a 50-incher for $850, a 55-incher for $1,000, and a 60-incher for $1,250. Things get a bit steeper from there, as the 65-inch M series sells for $1,500, the 70-incher is priced at $2,000, and a behemoth 80-inch model goes for $4,000.</p>
<p>Prices are even lower for the entry-level E series, and despite the entire range’s sub-$2,000 tags, you still get 4K resolution on many of the models. Of course, the penny-pinching shows: The E series panels don’t come with the HDR features, the 6-inch tablets, or the same amount of local-dimming zones as the higher-priced M-series sets. Still, you can toss content onto the big screen from your own mobile device via Chromecast with no extra dongles, and you get up to 12 zones of local dimming. For full-array UltraHD TVs with local-dimming and built-in Chromecasts, they’re insanely affordable.</p>
<p>There’s a 43-inch 4K E-series for just $470, a 48-inch 4K model for a mere $550, and a 4K 50-incher for $600. A cool $700 gets you a 55-inch 4K panel, $970 buys you a 4K 60-incher, and 65 inches of 4K goodness sets you back $1,100. The biggest of the E-series 4K panels is a 70-inch model for just $1,700—about $2.12 per square inch.</p>
