He has not been formally charged.</p><p>Assange had faced three other sexual assault charges in the country, but they expired in August because of the statute of limitations. The U.S. Justice Department said it is considering charging Assange with espionage related to WikiLeaks' publication of thousands of diplomatic letters.</p><p>The British and Swedish governments maintain the ruling from the U.N. is not legally binding, but the U.N. says the organization's conclusions "are legally binding to the extent that they are based on binding international human rights law."</p><p>A statement from Sweden said "Swedish authorities have no control over his decision to stay there. Mr. Assange is free to leave the Embassy at any point.”</p><p>The U.K. said it will formally contest the panel's decision.</p><p>"This changes nothing. We completely reject any claim that Julian Assange is a victim of arbitrary detention," the British government said in a statement.</p><p>"An allegation of rape is still outstanding and a European Arrest Warrant in place, so the U.K. continues to have a legal obligation to extradite him to Sweden," it said.</p><p>Assange said Thursday he would leave the embassy at noon Friday and allow British police to arrest him if the panel ruled against him.</p><p>The announcement by the panel comes more than 14 months after the Australian national <a href="https://justice4assange.com/IMG/pdf/assange-wgad.pdf">filed a complaint</a> about his detention.</p><p>Assange was initially detained at a London prison in 2010. When his appeal against extradition to Sweden was dismissed by Britain’s Supreme Court in May 2012 he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy the following month.</p><!-- cxenseparse_end --><p>Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1T1Xne3</p></div>
