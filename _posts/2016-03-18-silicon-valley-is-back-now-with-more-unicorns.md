<br><div id="start-of-content"><article class="content link-underline relative body-copy border-b pad-b-50" data-js="content" itemprop="articleBody" readability="60.289317507418"><p><iframe width="590" height="332" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gLJdzky63BA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></p>
<p>Union Civil War general Lew Wallace’s 1880 historical adventure novel <em>Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ</em> was the best-selling American novel of the 19th century, ahead of <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em>. It was first adapted into a film in 1907, and again in 1925—but most people are familiar with the 1959 Charlton Heston-starring version that won an unprecedented 11 Oscars. (That total has since been tied by <em>Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</em>.) It’s a sword-and-sandal epic that takes place during the time of Jesus Christ, and touts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frE9rXnaHpE" target="_blank">one of the most exhilarating action sequences</a> in all of American cinema.</p>
<p>All those Academy Awards kept the inclination for another remake at bay for nearly 60 years, but at long last, a fourth <em>Ben-Hur</em> film will hit theaters Aug. 12. Directed by Timur Bekmambetov (<em>Wanted</em>), it stars Jack Huston (<em>Boardwalk Empire</em>) as Ben-Hur, a prince in Jerusalem who is thrown into slavery after he’s betrayed by a childhood friend (played by Toby Kebbell). This time around, MGM and Paramount are working with husband and wife producing team Mark Burnett (<em>Survivor</em>) and Roma Downey (<em>Touched by an Angel</em>), who previously brought the popular but controversial miniseries <em>The Bible</em> to History Channel.</p>
<p>Biblical stories used to be tentpole movies for the major studios. Heston starred in both <em>Ben-Hur</em> and <em>The Ten Commandments</em>. And the past few years have seen an unmistakable rise in low-budget films directed at religious communities, specifically evangelical Christians, and raking in box-office dollars from audiences that mainstream films are missing. This first trailer doesn’t reveal much about the Christ storyline, which was mostly background detail in the 1959 film, but this version will reportedly feature a much bigger arc for Jesus (Rodrigo Santoro). So the time is ripe for a big-budget remake of a Hollywood classic—even one that trades sweeping grandeur for a remake with <em>Clash of the Titans</em>-style CGI effects and a healthy dose of <em>Gladiator</em> thrown in for good measure. </p>
<p><strong>Pause at:</strong> 0:17 for slave driver Quintus James Cosmo, better known as Jeor Mormont on <em>Game of Thrones</em>. 0:25 for a particularly nasty battering ram at the bow of an attacking ship. 0:40 for the first of many biblical motifs (accompanied by an <em>Inception</em> bwaaaaamp). 0:43 for Sheik Ilderim (Morgan Freeman), who prepares Ben-Hur for the chariot races. 1:32 for a glimpse of the iconic racetrack. 1:52 for Esther (Nazanin Boniadi, of <em>Homeland</em>). 2:10 for Judah Ben-Hur happening upon the crucifixion of Jesus. 2:20 to hear Messala (Kebbell) yell, “Are we having fun now, brother?” in the worst near-deployment of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VflIdXP46RU" target="_blank">Henry Pollard’s catchphrase</a> ever.</p>
