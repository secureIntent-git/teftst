<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocation">HAVANA</span> U.S. President Barack Obama promised one of Cuba's most prominent dissident groups he would raise the issues of freedom of speech and assembly with Cuban President Raul Castro during his March 20-22 visit to the Caribbean island.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>In a letter dated March 10, Obama praised the work of the Ladies in White, which marches weekly to protest Cuba's Communist government, and defended his policy of seeking to normalize relations with Cuba as good for its people.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>U.S. support for the dissidents is a source of tension ahead of Obama's visit, the first by a U.S. president since Fidel Castro's rebels overthrew a pro-American government in 1959.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>After more than half a century of Cold War-inspired animosity, the two sides promised 15 months ago to normalize relations.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The Ladies in White criticized Obama's policy change, saying the Cuban government continues to suppress dissent by breaking up anti-government demonstrations while maintaining a monopoly on the media. They say Cuba has cracked down more ferociously since rapprochement.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"We take seriously the concerns you have raised," said Obama's letter, which group leader Berta Soler read to about two dozen Ladies in White and other supporters gathered in a Havana park.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>"I will raise these issues directly with President Castro," said Obama, who called the Ladies "an inspiration to human rights movements around the world."</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>A senior U.S. official in Washington confirmed that an Obama aide delivered the letter to the Ladies in White in Miami.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>As in marches for the most of the last year, a demonstration on Sunday ended with police detaining the protesters after they were met by a larger group of pro-government counterdemonstrators.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Police detained about two dozen people, at which point the streets filled with conga dancers and drummers who led hundreds of government supporters in their own rally. The weekly demonstrations and detentions are normal, but the conga line was an additional flourish a week before Obama's visit.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Soler welcomed Obama's letter but still disagreed with him for enacting unilateral changes without any reciprocal moves by Cuba.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>"The response of this letter is positive for us, and we greatly appreciated it," Soler said minutes before she was detained. </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>The Cuban government dismisses the dissidents as mercenaries seeking to destabilize the country. Cuba also defends its universal healthcare and education as human rights and criticizes the U.S. record on race relations and the Guantanamo Bay military prison.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><span id="midArticle_14"/><p> (Reporting by Daniel Trotta; Additional reporting by Matt Spetalnick in Washington; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)</p><span id="midArticle_15"/></div>
