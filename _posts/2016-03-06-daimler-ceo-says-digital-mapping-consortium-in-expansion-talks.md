<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocation">ESTORIL, Portugal</span> Daimler's Chief Executive (<span id="symbol_DAIGn.DE_0">DAIGn.DE</span>) told Reuters that a German auto maker consortium which controls the HERE digital mapping business is in talks with potential new members.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>In August last year, German carmakers BMW (<span id="symbol_BMWG.DE_1">BMWG.DE</span>), Audi (<span id="symbol_VOWG_p.DE_2">VOWG_p.DE</span>) and Mercedes (<span id="symbol_DAIGn.DE_3">DAIGn.DE</span>), agreed to pay 2.5 billion euros ($2.8 billion) to buy Nokia's high definition maps business (<span id="symbol_NOKIA.HE_4">NOKIA.HE</span>), in a step to develop self-driving cars. </p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The deal closed in December and the German auto makers Mercedes-Benz, Audi and BMW started negotiations with new potential members, Zetsche said in an interview embargoed for Sunday.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"If there are individual companies that are already raising their finger, then this is fast and pleasing. I do not think it will take very long until the first company gives a binding commitment to join," Zetsche said at a Mercedes-Benz driving event in Portugal.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The HERE mapping business needs additional investments to make it viable for use as a navigation tool for self-driving cars. Having more carmakers join the consortium will potentially spread the cost across more members and could improve the volume of live traffic information being fed to the map from vehicles on the road. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Last week carmakers Renault-Nissan (<span id="symbol_RENA.PA_5">RENA.PA</span>), and supplier Continental (<span id="symbol_CONG.DE_6">CONG.DE</span>) said they were considering taking a stake in the HERE mapping consortium. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Intelligent mapping systems like HERE's are the basis on which self-driving cars, linked to wireless networks, can perform functions such as recalculating a route to the nearest electric charging station or around a traffic jam or accident.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Talks with third parties only started in the past two months because the consortium waited until the deal closed before talking to other partners, Zetsche said. Having only three members in the consortium made negotiations to close the deal simpler, Zetsche said.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>"Interest will not only be limited to Renault-Nissan and Continental," Zetsche added.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Self-driving and connected car services could become a $50 billion market, analysts at Exane BNP Paribas have estimated. Germany's carmakers decided to club together to bid for the asset to accelerate plans for self-driving cars after Internet rival Alphabet (<span id="symbol_GOOGL.O_7">GOOGL.O</span>) unveiled a prototype autonomous vehicle.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Now Daimler is ready to expand the business which will form the basis for interactive maps which include live data on traffic flows gathered by thousands of sensors on BMW, Audi and Mercedes-Benz vehicles. </p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>"It is clear that we want to aggressively expand this platform, we will make the means available to do this," Zetsche said.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>There are talks with the telecommunications industry about how to spread the availability of ultra-high-speed 5G networks, Zetsche said.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi are also evaluating whether their cooperation on maps can be broadened, Zetsche said. </p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>"When it concerns navigation, we have broadly identical needs. Setting communication standards, which language we should speak and what signals we send, we can decide together," Zetsche said. </p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>Daimler is on the lookout for software and information technology specialists to help develop its digital businesses, including through further takeovers.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>"To get access to the right resources we will continue making acquisitions," Zetsche said, explaining that there are currently no live talks for a deal. Daimler has already bought the MyTaxi App and any further deals will be about buying smaller companies, Zetsche said.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><span id="midArticle_2"/><p> (Reporting by Ilona Wissenbach; Writing by Edward Taylor; Editing by Stephen Powell)</p><span id="midArticle_3"/></div>
