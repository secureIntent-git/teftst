<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocatio&lt;/span&gt;n">U.S. prosecutors are expected on Friday to file a list of unindicted co-conspirators as part of the criminal case against two former allies of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in the "Bridgegate" scandal.</span></p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The court document could reveal how many individuals in the Christie administration or elsewhere were aware of the scheme to close down lanes at the busy George Washington Bridge in what prosecutors have said was an act of political retaliation against a local mayor.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Christie, a Republican who ran unsuccessfully for his party's presidential nomination this year, has denied any knowledge of the plot.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The people on the list have been described in court filings as individuals who joined the conspiracy but have not been criminally charged.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>In conspiracy cases, prosecutors do not always charge every person they believe had knowledge of the crime; for example, investigators may feel they do not have enough evidence to secure a conviction.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The list of names, long a source of speculation, was ordered released this week by U.S. District Judge Susan Wigenton in Newark after a consortium of media companies filed a motion seeking the information. The names have previously been provided to defense lawyers in the case.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Thus far, prosecutors have charged three people in the case. William Baroni, the former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, are facing trial on charges of wire fraud and civil rights deprivation in September.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>David Wildstein, also a former Port Authority official, has pleaded guilty and is cooperating with prosecutors.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Prosecutors have said Kelly and Baroni arranged for the September 2013 lane closure in Fort Lee, New Jersey, to pay back the municipality's Democratic mayor for refusing to endorse Christie's successful re-election bid.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>While Christie has not been implicated in the scheme, the timing of the trial could still prove to be an embarrassing distraction for the governor, who is heading up the transition team for presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. The U.S. presidential election takes place on Nov. 8. </p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>The list may not include every person who prosecutors believe was aware of the scheme. In court filings, prosecutors have distinguished between unindicted co-conspirators who "joined" the conspiracy and others who may have known of the plan but did not actively join.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>It is not clear how many individuals might fit into the latter category.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><p> (Reporting by Joseph Ax; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)</p><span id="midArticle_14"/></div>
