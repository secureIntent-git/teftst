<br><div readability="126.08318700615"> <p>David Cameron’s negotiations with fellow European Union leaders spilled into a second day as he pleaded for a deal on the U.K.’s membership of the bloc that he can sell to British voters.</p><p>With the talks dragging past midnight, the prime minister warned his 27 EU counterparts that he needed their help to win a referendum on staying inside the bloc, according to three European officials with knowledge of the meeting who asked not to be named because it wasn’t public. His terms included extending a mechanism allowing curbs on welfare payments for non-British EU citizens for a total of 13 years, they said.</p><p><a class="bbg-embed" href="https://twitter.com/David_Cameron/status/700311316586696704" data-type="iframe" data-embed-id="https://twitter.com/David_Cameron/status/700311316586696704" data-align="center" target="_blank" data-tracker-action="click" data-tracker-category="nav" data-tracker-label="inline_link.01">Twitter: David Cameron on Twitter</a></p><p>Cameron told the room that the draft accord published at the start of February had gone down badly at home, according to one of the officials. He told leaders he was confident he could win the referendum on Britain’s EU membership, but only if they granted him what he was requesting without watering down the terms, they said.</p><p>“I will not take a deal that doesn’t meet what we need,” the prime minister told reporters on Thursday as he arrived for the talks. “It’s much more important to get this right than to do anything in a rush.”</p><p><a href="http://www.bloombergview.com/quicktake/will-uk-leave-eu" data-web-url="http://www.bloombergview.com/quicktake/will-uk-leave-eu" data-tout-type="quicktake" id="_mce_temp_anchor" class="quicktake" data-tracker-action="click" data-tracker-category="recirc" data-tracker-label="inline_link.02"><span class="news-tout-title">QuickTake</span> <span class="news-tout-content">Will Britain Leave the EU?</span></a></p><p>The possibility that the U.K. might vote to leave has unsettled markets. Sterling has weakened since the start of the year over fears that businesses could quit Britain if it exits the EU. The pound’s volatility against the euro climbed for a third day Thursday, rising to the highest level since 2011.</p><p>At the opening session of the two-day summit in Brussels, the prime minister surprised colleagues with a pitch to extend a so-called emergency brake on welfare payments to 13 years: an initial suspension of seven years that could be lengthened twice by another three years each, according to the officials.</p><p>Leaders from eastern European nations said they would accept an emergency brake lasting no more than five years. Cameron’s office declined to comment on the specifics while the talks were ongoing.</p><p><a class="bbg-embed" href="https://twitter.com/PrebenEUspox/status/700555170640486401" data-type="iframe" data-embed-id="https://twitter.com/PrebenEUspox/status/700555170640486401" data-align="center" target="_blank" data-tracker-action="click" data-tracker-category="nav" data-tracker-label="inline_link.03">Twitter: Preben Aamann on Twitter</a></p><figure class="inline-image inline-media center ">  </figure><p>Cameron’s move to restrict social payments is aimed at discouraging migrants from traveling to the U.K. and taking advantage of a welfare system more generous than many other EU countries provide. His rationale was underlined by data this week that showed the number of people from other EU countries employed in the U.K. rose to 2.04 million at the end of 2015, compared with 1.23 million five years earlier.</p><p>Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo, whose country provides the largest share of EU migrants to the U.K., said she wanted a good agreement, “but not at any cost.”</p><h3>‘Credible’ Deal</h3><p>A British official speaking before midnight said the negotiations were tough and could be lengthy, and there wouldn’t be a deal unless real progress was made. Cameron had been planning to say that he needed an agreement that was “credible” for British voters and that the prize for the whole EU was to settle the issue of the U.K.’s relationship with Europe, moving to a “live and let live” approach.</p><p>“We certainly won’t be the only country that will have reservations,” Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka told reporters before the summit. “What’s on the table now is better than the earlier versions, but there are still some issues that we have to address.”</p><h3>Final Offer</h3><p>Belgium is meanwhile said to be <a itemscope="itemscope" itemprop="StoryLink" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-18/belgium-said-to-push-for-take-it-or-leave-offer-to-u-k" title="Belgium Said to Push for Take-It-or-Leave Offer to U.K." data-tracker-action="click" data-tracker-category="recirc" data-tracker-label="inline_link.04"><meta itemprop="active" content="true"/><meta itemprop="type" content="StoryLink"/><meta itemprop="suid" content="O2RB7D6JIJUR"/>pushing for language</a> to be inserted into the deal to make it clear that it is a final offer, and that rejecting it will mean Britain leaves the EU. The aim is to kill talk of a second referendum in the U.K., and to deter other nations from triggering referendums to get their own side deals.</p><p>Cameron is aiming to seal a deal at this summit, setting him up to announce a referendum as soon as June 23, and has said he will campaign to keep the U.K. in the EU. EU President Donald Tusk, who is chairing the meeting, told leaders he was prepared to extend the summit into Saturday and Sunday if that’s what it takes to get an accord, two officials said.</p><p>While the talks went into the small hours, British newspapers had already made up their minds about the outcome. The prime minister’s negotiations are a “shambles,” Friday’s Daily Mail said on its front page, alongside a photograph of Cameron looking anxious.</p><p>Other media signaled they regard Cameron’s negotiations as being of little value anyway. The Daily Express, a euro-skeptic newspaper, declared: “You can’t win, Prime Minister.”</p> </div>
