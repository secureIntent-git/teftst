They are expected to hold a vote in early July, several EU sources said, at which point it will enter into force.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Cross-border data transfers by businesses include payroll and human resources information as well as lucrative data used for targeted online advertising, which is of particular importance to tech companies.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>However, revelations of mass U.S. surveillance practices three years ago caused political outrage in Europe and fuelled distrust of big U.S. tech companies such as Facebook, Google and Apple.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Brussels and Washington rushed to hammer out the data pact after the EU's highest court last year struck down the previous system, Safe Harbour, on concerns about mass U.S. surveillance practices, threatening data flows that are key to billions of dollars of business.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>For 15 years Safe Harbour allowed both U.S. and European firms to get around tough EU data transferral rules by stating they complied with European privacy standards when storing information on U.S. servers.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>EU privacy regulators expressed concern about an initial deal struck in February.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>The U.S. government has now explained further the specific conditions under which intelligence services might have to collect data in bulk and safeguards on how the data is used, EU sources said.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>A letter from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, seen by Reuters, gives an example of the United States seeking information on the activities of a terrorist group in the Middle East believed to be plotting attacks against Europe.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>If Washington does not have information such as names, phone numbers or email addresses it would collect communications "to and from that region for further review and analysis to identify those communications that relate to the group," the letter says.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>"Thus, even when targeting through the use of specific selectors is not possible, the United States does not collect all communications from all communications facilities in the world."</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>The United States also explained how a new privacy official - whose role would be to field complaints from EU citizens about U.S. spying - would be independent from the intelligence services.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><span id="midArticle_14"/><p> (Reporting by Julia Fioretti; editing by Philip Blenkinsop/Keith Weir)</p><span id="midArticle_15"/></div>
