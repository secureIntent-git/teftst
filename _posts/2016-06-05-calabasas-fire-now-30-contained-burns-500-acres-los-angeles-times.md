                          <p>A fire in the hills of Calabasas Saturday prompted evacuations and burned more than 500 acres, damaged two homes and destroyed one commercial building, officials said Sunday morning.</p><p>Firefighters had the blazed, dubbed the Old fire, 30% contained early Sunday morning. On Saturday afternoon, with the temperature at about 100 degrees, hundreds of homes were threatened.</p>

            <p>Helicopters made repeated drops on hot spots, drawing water from Lake Calabasas, a man-made lake in the midst of a private development. </p><p>The fixed-wing aircraft that had been aiding the fight were no longer being used because of darkness, and the Fire Department did not expect to add additional neighborhoods to the evacuation area, Licon said. </p><p>Shari Davis was watching the television news as reporters said that much of Mountains Restoration Trust land used by her new summer day camp was scorched. Davis, who along with her husband owns and operates Camp Wildcraft, said, “I am kind of in despair at the moment.”</p><p>“It looks like a the whole area could be destroyed,” Davis said. </p><p>More than 50 children were set to arrive at the camp next week, and Davis said she was composing an e-mail to parents letting them know that the camp might need to make alternate plans. </p><p>“This was the first camp we were starting and everything was going so well with so much excitement and enthusiasm,” she said.  “We need to figure out a way to move ahead.”</p><p>Fire officials said they were investigating the possibility that the fire was started when a truck struck a power pole.
