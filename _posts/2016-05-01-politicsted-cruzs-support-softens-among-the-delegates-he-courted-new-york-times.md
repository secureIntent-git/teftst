While Mr. Poolman was looking for another candidate, he said, local Cruz volunteers asked if they could add his name to the list of delegate candidates supporting Mr. Cruz at the state convention. He said Mr. Cruz’s wife, Heidi, called him and gave him her cellphone number, saying he would always have “a direct line to the campaign.” And he was elected a delegate.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="198" data-total-count="4581">But now, Mr. Poolman said, he worries about party disunity and what it could mean for Republicans in November. “My goal, personally,” he said, “is to not let our convention become a circus.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="266" data-total-count="4847">The chairman of the North Dakota Republican Party, Kelly Armstrong, said Mr. Cruz’s appeal remained strong there, but put his support among the state’s 28 unbound delegates at “at least 10” — not quite the “vast majority” the Cruz campaign had claimed.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="237" data-total-count="5084">Mr. Armstrong, who has not taken sides, said delegates also had to consider how denying the nomination to Mr. Trump might look to his supporters, who have followed his lead in denouncing as corrupt any outcome other than a Trump victory.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="173" data-total-count="5257">“We can’t have a bunch of people really, really upset about the process and then think we’re going to be able to gain their support in November,” Mr. Armstrong said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="296" data-total-count="5553">The results in Pennsylvania were most troubling for Mr. Cruz. He had dominated the delegate fights in Colorado and Wyoming, contests that were influenced by the kinds of party activists Mr. Cruz tends to attract.

                A coalition of Republicans is banking on a scenario in which Donald J. Trump fails to reach the 1,237 delegates required to secure the party’s nomination before its July convention, creating a potential opening for another nominee as the delegates vote on the convention floor.            </p>

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="314" data-total-count="5997" id="story-continues-5">Mr. Khare declined to support any candidate before the election, though Mr. Cruz, Mr. Trump and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio all came calling, he said. “I was promised a photo, a private meeting. Forget about it,” Mr. Khare said, adding that he only ever intended to vote for the candidate who won in his district.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="283" data-total-count="6280">That would be Mr. Trump. Mr. Khare said he was not especially drawn to anything about Mr. Trump or his ideas. “Whether he will succeed or not, I don’t know,” he said. But he said he could not deny the will of so many voters. “There is a revolution going on here,” he added.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="357" data-total-count="6637">Voters, too, may be starting to share Mr. Trump’s reasoning that he would deserve the nomination even if he fell short of 1,237 delegates. A recent <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/poll-62-say-republican-most-votes-should-be-nominee-n556846">NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll</a> found that more than six in 10 Republicans believe the nominee should be the candidate with the most votes even if he does not have the support of the majority of delegates.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="168" data-total-count="6805">Still, Mr. Trump’s campaign is moving to nail down the delegate commitments he would need to get a majority, asking unbound delegates to sign pledges to vote for him.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="156" data-total-count="6961">With the Indiana primary potentially a make-or-break moment for stopping Mr. Trump, Mr. Cruz can only hope the campaign once again takes an unexpected turn.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="274" data-total-count="7235">“Trump is very popular in our state,” said Alec L. Poitevint II, a longtime Republican leader in Georgia and previously a Rubio supporter, but now uncommitted. He will be a bound delegate on the first ballot, but he has not yet been assigned to a presidential candidate.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="89" data-total-count="7324">And if he is required to vote for Mr. Trump, who won Georgia with 39 percent of the vote?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="28" data-total-count="7352">“Fine with me,” he said.</p><a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#whats-next">Continue reading the main story</a>
