No further details were given.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>A spokeswoman for Spitzer, Lisa Linden, said there was no truth to the allegation.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Spitzerâ€™s lawyer told the New York Times on Monday that a 26-year-old woman who told hospital staff that the former  governor had choked her had since recanted the claim and sent  an email apologizing for the false statement.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Attorney Adam Kaufmann said he had sent the email to the Manhattan District Attorney's office.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Reuters could not immediately reach Kaufmann to confirm the  report.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
