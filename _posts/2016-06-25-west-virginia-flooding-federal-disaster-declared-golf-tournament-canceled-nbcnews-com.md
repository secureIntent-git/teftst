                    <p> The rains — so heavy they were dubbed a "one-in-a-thousand-year event" by the National Weather Service — prompted officials to put 44 out of West Virginia's 55 counties under a state of emergency, primarily in the southeastern part of the state. </p>

                    <p> "It's been a long 24 hours. The next 24 hours may not be much easier," Tomblin said Friday afternoon, after authorities spent the day rescuing people off rooftops and whisking them out of their homes as water rose at an alarming speed. </p>
