	Boxing legend Muhammad Ali, who died Friday night at the age of 74, is widely hailed as one of the greatest boxers to ever live, with a career record of 56-5 and 37 KOs. Known for his “Ali Shuffle” and “rope-a-dope” tactics, Ali utilized his speed and boxing IQ to become the first fighter in boxing history to win the heavyweight championship three times.</p>&#13;
                          &#13;

<p>&#13;
	While many boxers in today’s era are heavily criticized for hand-picking their opponent, rather than fight the one who would pose the biggest challenge, Ali rose through the heavyweight ranks defeating the likes of Sonny Liston, Joe Frazier and George Foreman—all of whom are in the Boxing Hall of Fame—and giving the world some of the greatest fights in boxing history.</p>    &#13;

	Here are 10 of Ali’s legendary fights.</p>    &#13;

	<strong>1. Oct. 29, 1974: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/ali-wins-ko-8-floors-foreman-regain-crown-article-1.1993051">Muhammad Ali vs. George Foreman; “The Rumble in the Jungle”</a></strong></p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	Despite coming off of an impressive win over Frazier, Ali was—once again—viewed as a heavy underdog in the weeks leading up to his bout with Foreman. Foreman (40-0, 37 KOs), 25, was considered stronger, younger and was generally more feared than Ali, after defeating both Frazier and Norton in two rounds each.</p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	Ali knew most people didn’t think he’d be able to win, saying as much during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpEh1zNacjU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2m38s">one his pre-fight trash talking rants</a>, “And you, George Foreman! All of you chumps are gonna bow, when I whoop him. All of ya! I know you got him, I know you got him picked…But the man’s in trouble. I’m gonna show you how great I am!”</p>     <p> <a class="ra-related" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/muhammad-ali-transcended-boxing-humanitarian-pacifist-article-1.2660726">Muhammad Ali transcended boxing as a humanitarian, pacifist</a> </p>     &#13;
<p>&#13;
	And he did. <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/ali-wins-ko-8-floors-foreman-regain-crown-article-1.1993051">Throughout the fight Ali applied his famous “rope-a-dope” tactic</a>, positioning himself on the ropes and using his arms to cover himself and deflect Foreman’s punches. As a result, Foreman quickly fatigued, allowing Ali to respond with quick punches and combinations of his own. As Foreman grew tired, his punches lost its vicious power. Ali eventually knocked out an exhausted Foreman in the eighth round.</p>    &#13;

	<strong>2. March 8, 1971: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/smokin-joe-frazier-topples-muhammad-ali-15th-article-1.2097879">Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier I; “The Fight of the Century”</a></strong></p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	Leading up to the fight both Ali (31-0, 25 KOs) and Frazier (26-0, 23 KOs) were undefeated and had legitimate claims to the title of Heavyweight Champion of the World. After defeating Liston in 1964, Ali had successfully defended his title up until he was stripped of his belt and banned from boxing in 1967 for refusing to be inducted into the armed forces. In Ali’s three-year absence, Frazier rose through the heavyweight ranks and at the time was recognized by boxing authorities as the World Champion.</p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	As a result, the fight was billed as “The Fight of the Century.” While Ali led the earlier rounds, he was unable to keep up with the face pace he had set and succumbed himself to multiple devastating blows from Frazier. Frazier was able to use his famous left hook, followed by a flurry of combinations, to visibly hurt Ali throughout the middle-to-later rounds. He eventually knocked Ali to the canvas twice, in rounds 11 and 15 and won the fight by unanimous decision.</p>     <p> <a class="ra-related" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/muhammad-ali-suffered-beliefs-legend-article-1.2660831">Muhammad Ali suffered for his beliefs before becoming a legend</a> </p>     &#13;

	<strong>3. Oct. 1, 1975: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/boxing/muhammad-ali-tkos-joe-frazier-14th-1975-article-1.2379718">Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier III; “The Thrilla in Manilla”</a></strong></p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	The third bout between Ali and Frazier was the duo’s most gruesome. While Ali once again got off to an early start, Frazier eventually was able to gather himself and land multiple body punches while Ali attempted to implement his rope-a-dope strategy in the third round.</p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	Throughout the rest of the fight the two would trade vicious combinations that left both of them bloody and beaten. After enduring a barrage of punches from Frazier in the sixth round, <a href="http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/7207505/celebrating-trilogies-muhammad-ali-joe-frazier">Ali said to him</a> at the start of the seventh, “Old Joe Frazier, they told me you were washed up.”</p>     <p> <a class="ra-related" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/lupica-muhammad-ali-made-world-stand-watch-article-1.2660817">Lupica: Muhammad Ali made the whole world stand up and watch</a> </p>     &#13;
<p>&#13;
	“They lied, pretty boy,” Frazier responded.</p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	The decisive turning point for Ali came in Round 14. Ali repeatedly threw a vicious cycle of combinations that staggered Frazier, leaving him half-blinded and completely helpless. <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/more-sports/boxing/muhammad-ali-tkos-joe-frazier-14th-1975-article-1.2379718">“Nothing but the gigantic heart and legs were holding up Joe Frazier,” the Daily News wrote</a>. Frazier’s corner decided to call the fight after the round, giving Ali the win by technical knockout. Ali immediately fell to the canvas in sheer exhaustion, giving everything he had.</p>    &#13;

	<strong>4. Feb. 24, 1964: <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/cassius-king-ring-tkos-liston-7th-article-1.2089438">Cassius Clay vs. Sonny Liston I</a></strong></p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	Despite entering the fight as a 7-1 underdog, Ali (still known as Cassius Clay) repeatedly mocked Liston prior to their heavyweight championship showdown, referring to him as “an ugly bear.” When asked about being viewed as the underdog and the villain—due to his cocky comments—Ali famously responded, “That’s the way I like it. That makes me rumble. Don’t we rumble? Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. Rumble young man rumble.”</p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	Throughout the bout <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/cassius-king-ring-tkos-liston-7th-article-1.2089438">Ali was able to use his superior speed to avoid Liston’s wildly-swinging punches</a> and control the fight with ease, the Daily News reported. During the sixth round Ali landed several combinations that staggered, and visibly hurt, Liston. After the round, Liston complained in his corner that he couldn’t continue due to an injured shoulder and failed to answer the seventh round bell, giving Ali the win by technical knockout.</p>     <p> <a class="ra-related" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/muhammad-ali-knew-tribute-late-bill-gallo-article-1.2660767">The Muhammad Ali I knew: A tribute by the late Bill Gallo</a> </p>     &#13;
<p>&#13;
	After he realized Liston could no longer fight, Ali danced in the center of the ring before yelling, “I am the greatest!” In the coming months after the fight, Ali joined the Nation of Islam and legally changed his name from Cassius Clay to Cassius X, before eventually changing it to Muhammad Ali.</p>    &#13;

<p>&#13;
	<strong>5. Nov. 14, 1966: Muhammad Ali vs. Cleveland Williams</strong></p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	While Ali’s later fights against Joe Frazier and George Foreman are his most memorable, his fight against Williams is considered by many as his most dominant. Williams entered the fight coming off of nine straight victories and sporting a 65-5-1 record and 53 KOs. However, it was the younger and less-experienced Ali who dominated the fight from the start. Ali landed 62 percent of his power punches, 46 of 74, while Williams only managed to land 10 punches the entire fight, according to CompuBox.</p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	The Daily News described Ali’s performance as “a savage, slashing display of punching power” as Ali knocked Williams down four times and left him bloodied, bewildered and helpless before referee Harry Kessler stopped the fight early in the third round. The fight against Williams was also the introduction of the “Ali Shuffle” where Ali quickly dances his feet before unleashing a combination of punches.</p>      &#13;
<p>&#13;
	“I put it into use just before the two combinations,” Ali told the Daily News after the fight. “It’s just a quick shuffle of the feet but it really confused Williams. This is another rule of boxing that I have created.”</p>    &#13;
                                                                                <div class="ra-module h" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemid="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/1465049349_551_Muhammad-Ali-Remembering-his-10-greatest-fights-New-York-Daily-News.jpg">

    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	<strong>6. Jan. 28, 1974: Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier II; “Super Fight II”</strong></p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	The second fight between Ali and Frazier didn’t feature nearly the same build-up and hype, as this time around neither had any claim to the world heavyweight title. Ali was coming off of a rematch split-decision win over Norton and a unanimous decision win over Rudi Lubbers, while Frazier recently won a points decision over Joe Bugner and was attempting to bounce back after a demolishing loss to Foreman. Shortly after defeating Ali in their first bout, Frazier lost his heavyweight championship belt to Foreman, getting knocked down six times before the referee stopped the fight in just the second round.</p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	While the fight may not have generated as much fanfare as the previous matchup, the bout still had plenty of importance as the assumption was the winner of Ali-Frazier II would be given a title shot against Foreman.</p>      &#13;
<p>&#13;
	The fight itself was once again a close and thrilling bout. This time, however, it was Ali getting the better of Frazier, using a fury of combinations followed by frequent clinches, winning by way of unanimous decision.</p>    &#13;

	<strong>7. Feb. 6, 1967: Muhammad Ali vs. Ernie Terrell; “What’s my name?”</strong></p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	In one of the few instances of Ali’s career, his opponent was the one who initiated the pre-fight banter. Prior to the fight, Terrell repeatedly called Ali “Clay”, refusing to call him by his recently-adopted name, Muhammad Ali.</p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	Ali, who viewed his surname Clay as a “slave name”, didn’t take to kindly to Terrell’s perceived disrespect. “I want to torture him,” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130309201457/http:/sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1079523/1/index.htm">Ali told Sports Illustrated at the time</a>. “I want to give him the Patterson humiliation and punish him. A clean knockout is too good for him.”</p>      &#13;
<p>&#13;
	Ali did just that. After dominating Terrell for the majority of the fight, Ali repeatedly taunted him in the later rounds, shouting at a bloodied and beaten Terrell, “What’s my name?” and then throwing a punch. He’d then shout again, “What’s my name?” followed by another punch, the Daily News reported. This would continue for the majority of the late rounds. For many in attendance, it appeared that Ali prolonged the fight—he would win nearly every round en route to a unanimous decision—just so he could inflict as much damage as humanly possible.</p>    &#13;

	<strong>8. Sept. 15, 1978: Muhammad Ali vs. Leon Spinks II</strong></p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	Ali lost to Spinks just seven months prior, a shocking split decision loss to a fighter who, at the time, had just seven professional fights under his belt and was coming off of a draw. Spinks was a 10-1 underdog and received a purse of just $320,000 to Ali’s $3.5 million.</p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	After the first fight, the two agreed to a rematch. This time Ali dominated. Rather than use his rope-a-dope strategy, Ali instead would jab one-to-two times, throw a right and then clinch—inflicting the most damage he could before embracing Spinks, limiting him to one or two punches. He won the fight by unanimous decision, becoming the first fighter in history to win the World Heavyweight Championship three times.</p>      &#13;
<p>&#13;
	It would be the last win of Ali’s career. After a brief retirement, Ali would lose his next two fights to Larry Holmes and Trevor Berbick before once again retiring, this time for good.</p>    &#13;

	<strong>9. March 31, 1973: Muhammad Ali vs. Ken Norton I</strong></p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	After losing to Frazier, Ali strung together six straight victories and was poised for a title fight against then-heavyweight champion George Foreman, who had previously defeated Frazier to claim the title. Norton was a 5-1 underdog and was widely viewed as a tune-up fight for an Ali-Foreman championship bout.</p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	Despite not being seen as a serious contender, Norton proved to be a more than admirable adversary early on in the fight, breaking Ali’s jaw in the process. With an unorthodox fighting style, that including throwing his jab from his waist rather than his shoulder, Norton defeated Ali by way of split decision.</p>      &#13;
<p>&#13;
	After the fight, many believed the 31-year-old former champion was done. He was far from.</p>    &#13;

	<strong>10. March 13, 1963: Cassius Clay vs. Doug Jones</strong></p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	Ali, who at the time went by his birth name of Cassius Clay, endured his most grueling fight of his then-young career when he went up against fellow heavyweight Doug Jones. The fight, which was fought at Madison Square Garden and would later be called the “Fight of the Year”, featured several hard blows from both fighters.</p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	The Associated Press reported that Jones actually had the lead going into the ninth, but lost the final two rounds. Ali would win by unanimous decision.</p>      &#13;
<p>&#13;
	Then-heavyweight champion Sonny Liston, who was in attendance for the fight, told the AP he was unimpressed with Ali’s performance. “Clay showed me that I’ll get locked up for murder if we’re ever matched,” he said.</p>    &#13;
