And fundamental trends are intrinsically impressive. And valuation looks compelling. Then that's when you buy," RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said in a client note.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Susquehanna Financial Group analysts agreed. "While headline numbers missed, the key revenue number was fine," they wrote.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
