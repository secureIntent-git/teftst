<br><div id=""><p>Facebook and Instagram are cracking down on cannabis. No, they aren’t coming after you, or even <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/8M0xANBM-m/" target="_blank">pot princess</a> Rihanna (not that they could stop her). They’re going after the dispensaries and marketers.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the social media services started <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/facebook-marijuana-cannabis-businesses-crackdown" target="_blank">closing the accounts</a> of such operations, arguing such outfits violate their terms of service (does anyone actually read those?). Of course, there’s a social media platform for everything, including weed, so more and more marijuana businesses (and users) are embracing platforms like <a href="http://socialhigh.com/" target="_blank">Social High</a> or <a href="https://massroots.com/" target="_blank">MassRoots</a>, both of which cater explicitly to … well, let’s call them consumers.</p>
<p>These are far from the only 420-friendly analogs of familiar apps out there. From Seamless to Tinder to Yelp to Snapchat, the cannabiz industry is booming. So if you really want to Weed Yo Screen (yes, that’s a real app), take a look below.</p>
<h3>Yelp: Leafly</h3>
<p>It’s almost impossible to keep up with all the strains available these days, even if science says <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/08/sorry-names-weed-strains-kinda-meaningless/" target="_blank">names don’t tell you much anyway</a>. Have no fear. Leafly is here to help you make an informed choice between Sour Diesel, Lemon Haze, and Alaskan Thunderfuck.</p>
<p>Leafly has a large and searchable database of strains and products, which you can filter by effect, mood, medicinal properties, and flavor. Each strain has a page of reviews, a list of nearby dispensaries where you can get it, and a surprising amount of data. When you write a review, you can make it public or keep it in your private “journal,” which you’re supposed to use to track your personal experience with pot. You’ll never have to rely on the recommendation of snobby (or spacey) budtenders again.</p>
<h3>Google Maps: Weedmaps</h3>
<p>Even in states where selling weed is legal, dispensaries can be <a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/10/pot-shots/" target="_blank">transient and tricky to find</a>. Luckily, Weedmaps is to dispensaries what Google Maps is to everything else. Provided that you live in a state that has legalized medical marijuana, Weedmaps will help you find what you need—whether that’s a dispensary, a delivery service, or a doctor who knows just how to cure that anxiety/insomnia/night blindness.</p>
<h3>Uber: Eaze</h3>
<p>Delivery services have likely existed for as long as people have been smoking the stuff, and remain a thriving industry in cities where cannabis isn’t yet legal. But in California, Eaze and Meadow—two of the companies vying for the “Uber of Weed” title—are trying to push the process past “dude showing up at your house with his selection hidden in a fake can of tennis balls.” Both services aggregate the offerings of your local dispensaries, a la Seamless and Grubhub; you make your choices in-app, punch in your address, and wait for the goods to be delivered to your door.</p>
<p>You need a medical marijuana license to order, but even that’s part of the process: For a fee, Eaze and Meadow will arrange a video conference between you and a doctor in lieu of a more traditional medical marijuana consultation. And from that point, Eaze distinguishes itself as even more Uber-like: with your medical marijuana card in hand, you can apply to become a Eaze driver (and make $16/hour, plus tips).</p>
<h3>Snapchat: Cheech &amp; Chong’s The Fatty</h3>
<p>Anyone who knows a teenager has figured out that Facebook is dead and rotting, and Snapchat reigns supreme. Cheech &amp; Chong’s The Fatty (AKA Cheech &amp; Chong’s Ultra Mega Super Nitro Boost Powered App) is like Snapchat … if Snapchat only cared about letting you add Cheech and Chong to all your photos. It also features “Kush Notifications,” which give you helpful reminders like “Don’t forget your pants,” and the “World’s Greatest Clock Ever,” which is always set to 4:20.</p>
<h3>Farmville: Weed Firm: RePlanted</h3>
<p>There’s a bumper crop of cannabis-cultivation games out there, but <em>WFRP</em> is the most popular. Like Farmville, it mixes role-playing mechanics, social sharing, and agriculture. Unlike Farmville, it’s totally weed-centric. As you tend your plants and maximize your strains’ effectiveness, you can pimp out your dispensary, spin records and smoke with stoners, and defend your store from menaces that range from corrupt cops to aliens.</p>
<h3>Tinder: Duby and High There!</h3>
<p>No millennial’s home screen would be complete without some kind of swipe right/swipe left app. Duby puts the emphasis on weed. Users upload weed-related pictures (buds, bongs, bowls—anything) and other people either swipe right to “pass it on” or swipe left to “put it out.”</p>
<p>High There!, on the other hand, is definitely just Weed Tinder. Like Duby, it has the Tinder-style swiping interface (this time your options are either High There! or Bye There!). High There! bills itself as a tool to expand your smoking circle … but that’s not the message we’re getting from the sample photos. As legalization pushes cannabis culture more and more <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/01/privateer-founders-fund/" target="_blank">into the mainstream</a>, this feels unnecessary, but to each their own niche dating app.</p>
