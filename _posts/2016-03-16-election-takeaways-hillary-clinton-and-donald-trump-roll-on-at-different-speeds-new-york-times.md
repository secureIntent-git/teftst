John Kasich of Ohio did something unprecedented for him on Tuesday night: He won a state. To be sure, it was the state that elected him to nine terms in Congress and two as governor — but still, it was a breakthrough of a kind.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="396" data-total-count="3156" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-4">Winning Ohio, however, is valuable only if it helps spur a larger shift toward Mr. Kasich across the industrial Midwest. So far, he has little to show for all the attention he has lavished on the region. He finished third in Michigan last week and a distant third in Missouri on Tuesday. His best performance outside Ohio was pulling a fifth of the vote in Illinois — and again finishing third.</p><div id="MiddleRight1" class="ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

</div><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="118" data-total-count="3274" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-5">That’s not a regional campaign. It is a one-state candidacy. The pressure is on Mr. Kasich to show he can do better.</p><h4 id="subhead-4" class="story-subheading story-content" data-para-count="21" data-total-count="3295" itemprop="articleBody">Sanders has a ceiling</h4><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="411" data-total-count="3706" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Sanders has a strong and durable political coalition, just not one that ultimately adds up to victory in a Democratic primary. Young people continue to support him — he won among voters under 45 in every state but Florida on Tuesday — as do white voters in most states. But Mr. Sanders would have needed to make deep inroads with nonwhites by now to have a strong shot at the nomination, and he has not.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="218" data-total-count="3924" itemprop="articleBody">The calendar, however, is his friend: While the odds are powerfully against him, the next few rounds of voting will take place in states like Utah and Wisconsin, which resemble contests Mr. Sanders has won in the past.</p><h4 id="subhead-5" class="story-subheading story-content" data-para-count="32" data-total-count="3956" itemprop="articleBody">Republicans are divided by class</h4><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="371" data-total-count="4327" itemprop="articleBody">The most important dividing lines in the Republican coalition are income and education levels. Mr. Trump has consistently scored better with less-educated voters, and the elections on Tuesday were no exception: Even as he lost Ohio by 11 points, Mr. Trump won pluralities there of white voters who lack college degrees, and of Ohioans who earn less than $50,000 per year.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="231" data-total-count="4558" itemprop="articleBody">In three states with close races — Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina — Mr. Trump won nearly half of voters without college degrees. But the best he managed with college graduates was a tie with Senator Ted Cruz in Illinois.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="149" data-total-count="4707" itemprop="articleBody">If Mr. Trump became the nominee, Republicans might risk a large-scale defection by upscale whites who voted willingly for Mitt Romney four years ago.</p>
