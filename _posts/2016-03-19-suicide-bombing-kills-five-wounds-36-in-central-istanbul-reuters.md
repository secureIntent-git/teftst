<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="3"><p><span class="articleLocation">ISTANBUL/ANKARA</span> Five people including a suicide bomber were killed and 36 wounded in a suspected attack by Kurdish militants on a major shopping and tourist district in central Istanbul on Saturday.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The fourth suicide bombing in Turkey this year hit part of Istiklal Street, a long pedestrian zone lined with global brand name shops and foreign consulates, just a few hundred meters from an area where police buses are usually parked.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Preliminary findings indicate that the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) or an affiliate carried out the attack, a senior Turkish official told Reuters.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"The attacker detonated the bomb before reaching the targeted point because they were scared of the police," the official said, adding the bomber had planned to hit a more crowded spot.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Armed police sealed off the shopping street where half a dozen ambulances had gathered. Forensic teams in white suits scoured the area for evidence. Police helicopters buzzed overhead and panicked shoppers fled the area, ducking down narrow sidestreets.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>"My local shopkeeper told me someone had blown himself up and I walked toward the end of the street," one neighborhood resident told Reuters. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>"I saw a body on the street. No one was treating him but then I saw someone who appeared to be a regular citizen trying to do something to the body. That was enough for me and I turned and went back."</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Istiklal Street, usually thronged with shoppers on weekends, was quieter than normal before the blast as more people are staying home after a series of deadly bombings.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Health Minister Mehmet Muezzinoglu confirmed that 36 people had been wounded and seven of those were in serious condition. Twelve of the wounded were foreigners, he said. Israel's foreign ministry confirmed some of its citizens were among the wounded.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>"We as a nation are unfortunately now face to face with a situation of unlimited, immeasurable acts that are inhumane, defy human values and are treacherous," Muezzinoglu said. </p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>DEADLY BOMBINGS</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>A suicide car bombing in the capital Ankara killed 37 people this month. A similar bombing in Ankara last month killed 29 people. A Kurdish militant group has claimed responsibility for both of those bombings.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>In January, a suicide bomber killed around 10 people, most of them German tourists, in Istanbul's historic heart, an attack the government blamed on Islamic State.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>NATO member Turkey faces multiple security threats. As part of a U.S.-led coalition, it is fighting Islamic State in neighboring Syria and Iraq. It is also battling PKK militants in its southeast, where a 2-1/2-year ceasefire collapsed last July, triggering the worst violence since the 1990s.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>In its armed campaign in Turkey, the PKK has historically struck directly at the security forces and says that it does not target civilians. However, the recent bombings suggest it could be moving toward a tactical shift. A claim of direct responsibility for Saturday's attack could underscore that.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>The PKK is looking to carry out attacks aggressively during the coming Newroz spring holiday, the official said. Newroz, which falls on March 21, is Kurdish New Year. </p><span id="midArticle_1"/><span id="midArticle_2"/><span id="midArticle_3"/><p> (Additional reporting by Ayla Jean Yackley, Asli Kandemir, Humeyra Pamuk and Daren Butler; Writing by David Dolan; Editing by Tom Heneghan)</p><span id="midArticle_4"/></div>
