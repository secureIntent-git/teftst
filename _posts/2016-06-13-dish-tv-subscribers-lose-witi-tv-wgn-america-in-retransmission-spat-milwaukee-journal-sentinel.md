                            <p><a href="http://www.dish.com/">Dish Network</a> subscribers in the Milwaukee area lost <a href="http://fox6now.com/">WITI-TV (Channel 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.wgnamerica.com/">WGN America</a> Sunday after the satellite TV provider and WITI's parent company, <a href="http://www.tribunemedia.com/">Tribune Media,</a> failed to come to an agreement on retransmission fees by a 6 p.m. deadline. </p><p>Dish issued a statement Sunday night saying Tribune had pulled its 42 local channels, including WITI, from Dish systems in 34 states. The satellite company said it would offer over-the-air antennas at no cost to subscribers so they can get the local channels for free while they're missing on the service. </p><p>In the statement, Warren Schlichting, Dish executive vice president of programming, called the fee increase Tribune "unreasonable." He also said Tribune was trying to "force bundle" its cable channel WGN America as part of the deal. </p><p>"We want to reach an agreement, just as we have with every one of our other cable, satellite and telco distributors, but Dish refuses to reach an agreement based on fair-market value," Gary Weitman, Tribune Media's senior vice president for corporate relations, said in a statement Sunday night. "We want to keep servicing our local communities and we have repeatedly offered Dish a lengthy extension to continue negotiations — unfortunately, Dish rejected these offers."</p><p>As it did last fall during <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/tvradio/att-u-verse-witi-tv-parent-tribune-reach-retransmission-deal-b99603927z1-337231191.html">its battle over a retransmission deal with Time Warner Cable,</a> WITI's parent created a page online — <a href="http://www.dumpdish.com/witi"><i>dumpdish.com/witi</i></a> — urging viewers to switch from Dish to another service. On Sunday night, the site was changed to read: "Dish forced WITI FOX 6 off your lineup...so you can't watch the channel you're paying for."</p>
