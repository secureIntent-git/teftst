        <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="253" data-total-count="2364" id="story-continues-3">In September, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/09/us/freddie-gray-baltimore-police-death.html">Baltimore agreed to pay $6.4 million</a> to the family of Freddie Gray, who died in police custody. And last year, New York City <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/14/nyregion/eric-garner-case-is-settled-by-new-york-city-for-5-9-million.html">agreed to pay $5.9 million</a> to the family of Eric Garner, who died after being placed in a chokehold by an officer.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="107" data-total-count="2471">Officials in Cleveland’s mayor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="346" data-total-count="2817">Tamir had been carrying a real-looking pellet gun near a recreation center when someone called 911 to report him. The caller cautioned that Tamir was “probably a juvenile” and that the weapon was “probably fake,” but those qualifications were not relayed to the responding officers, who were told only of a report of a male with a weapon.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="325" data-total-count="3142">Moments later, as grainy surveillance footage showed, a squad car drove over a curb and through snow-dotted grass before sliding to a halt within feet of Tamir. Officer Loehmann, who <a href="http://prosecutor.cuyahogacounty.us/pdf_prosecutor/en-US/Tamir%20Rice%20Investigation/Officer%20Loehmann%20Statement.pdf">said later that he had feared for his life</a> and had seen Tamir reaching for his waistband, stepped out of the cruiser and quickly shot the boy.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="289" data-total-count="3431">Tamir’s shooting, which happened two days before a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/25/us/ferguson-darren-wilson-shooting-michael-brown-grand-jury.html">grand jury in Missouri declined to charge</a> the Ferguson officer who fatally shot Michael Brown, an African-American 18-year-old, also occurred amid a wave of new attention on use of force by the police, and set off protests in Cleveland.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="336" data-total-count="3767">From the outset, activists, the leader of the local police union and Cleveland’s mayor agreed that Tamir’s death was tragic. But the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/25/us/71-arrested-in-cleveland-protests-over-officers-acquittal-police-say.html">city was deeply divided</a> on whether Officer Loehmann and his partner, Officer Frank Garmback, who was driving the cruiser, had committed crimes, or had been justified given what they knew at the time.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="390" data-total-count="4157" id="story-continues-4">As the case made national headlines, it was revealed that Officer Loehmann had resigned from another Ohio police department after a “dangerous loss of composure” during weapons training. Many questioned his decision to fire quickly, as well as the tactics of Officer Garmback, who did not shoot but whose fast approach left his partner little time to assess the situation before acting.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="343" data-total-count="4500">Tensions escalated last year when Cleveland filed a response to the lawsuit that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/03/us/cleveland-mayor-apologizes-for-language-used-to-blame-tamir-rice-for-his-death.html">seemed to blame Tamir for his death</a>, prompting an apology from the mayor and a revised filing. Then, in February, Cleveland moved to sue the Rice family for $500 to cover Tamir’s emergency medical treatment, but <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/12/us/cleveland-500-bill-tamir-rice-shooting.html">quickly reversed course</a> after a public backlash.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="387" data-total-count="4887">The investigation of Tamir’s death <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/us/sheriffs-report-provides-new-details-on-tamir-rices-death-but-leaves-questions.html">stretched over 13 months</a>, and was handed from agency to agency, frustrating activists who saw it as a clear-cut case of police misconduct. Finally, in a hastily organized news conference during the week between Christmas and New Year’s Day, the county prosecutor, Timothy J. McGinty, announced that grand jurors had declined to charge the officers.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="440" data-total-count="5327">By that point, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/24/us/tamir-rices-family-and-prosecutor-quarrel-over-release-of-evidence.html">Mr. McGinty had been widely criticized</a> for his approach to the case. In what he said was an effort at transparency, Mr. McGinty released investigative documents on a piecemeal basis before the grand jury’s decision, including <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/us/2-outside-reviews-say-cleveland-officer-acted-reasonably-in-shooting-tamir-rice-12.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=U.S.&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=Marginalia&amp;pgtype=article">reports from outside experts</a> he had hired who found the shooting justified. The Rice family called for Mr. McGinty to recuse himself, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/30/us/lawyers-for-tamir-rices-family-release-outside-reports-criticizing-shooting.html">hired its own experts</a>, who found the shooting unreasonable.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="121" data-total-count="5448">The Rice case figured prominently in Mr. McGinty’s re-election campaign, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/17/us/angered-by-cities-handling-of-police-shootings-voters-oust-two-prosecutors.html">last month he lost</a> the Democratic primary.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="237" data-total-count="5685">Tamir’s death also brought increased scrutiny to the Cleveland Police Department, which is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/27/us/cleveland-police-accept-use-of-force-rules-in-justice-dept-deal.html">operating under a consent decree</a> with the Justice Department and has been involved in a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/26/us/cleveland-police.html">series of high-profile incidents</a> involving black people.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="566" data-total-count="6251">Tanisha Anderson, a black woman said to be suffering from mental illness, died in 2014 after being restrained by officers. The medical examiner ruled her death a homicide, and the case remains under investigation. In another case, Mr. McGinty brought manslaughter charges against a Cleveland officer, Michael Brelo, for his role in the 2012 deaths of Malissa Williams and Timothy Russell, unarmed African-Americans who had led officers on a long chase. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/us/michael-brelo-cleveland-police-officer-acquitted-of-manslaughter-in-2012-deaths.html">Mr. Brelo was acquitted</a> by a judge but has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/27/us/six-cleveland-officers-fired-for-role-in-2012-fatal-shooting-of-couple.html">since been fired</a> for violating department policies during the episode.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="174" data-total-count="6425">In their statement on Monday, the Rice family’s lawyers, from the New York firm of Emery Celli Brinckerhoff and Abady, said, “Tamir’s death is not an isolated event.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="390" data-total-count="6815">“The problem of police violence, especially in communities of color, is a crisis plaguing our nation,” the lawyers, Mr. Abady and Mr. Ward, said in the statement. “It is the sincere hope of the Rice family that Tamir’s death will stimulate a movement for genuine change in our society and our nation’s policing so that no family ever has to suffer a tragedy such as this again.”</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#whats-next">Continue reading the main story</a>
