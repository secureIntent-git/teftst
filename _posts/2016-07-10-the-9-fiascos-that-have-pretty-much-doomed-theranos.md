					<p>At this time last year, the blood testing startup Theranos hit its zenith. The company was worth $9 billion, it had just received FDA clearance for one of its proprietary devices, and its founder, Elizabeth Holmes, was the model of a young, talented, disruptive CEO.</p>
<p>And then … well, many things happened, beginning with sobering revelations published in one of the nation’s top newspapers, followed by months of regulatory referendums, internal shakeups, and lawsuits. Now, federal regulators have essentially banned Holmes from the blood testing business and yanked the certification from its flagship laboratory. Theranos is at its nadir.</p>

Holmes will stay on as CEO. “The clinical lab is just one of Theranos’ many opportunities to provide access to high-integrity, affordable and actionable health care information, and the company will continue to carry out its mission under the leadership of its founder and CEO, Elizabeth Holmes,” the company said in a statement. Theranos has indicated it will appeal CMS’s decision. But if that doesn’t work out, the company will probably attempt to survive by leasing or selling its intellectual property to its former competitors.</p>
