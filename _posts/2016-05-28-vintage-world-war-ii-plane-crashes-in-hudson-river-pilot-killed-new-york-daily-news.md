	The pilot of a World War II plane was killed after his aircraft crashed into the Hudson River Friday, officials and witnesses said.</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	The single-seater P-47 Thunderbolt fighter began smoking and listing to one side as it buzzed over the water and went down just south of the Edgewater Marina in Edgewater, N.J., around 7:30 p.m., witnesses said.</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	“It made kind of a U-turn and then there was a stream of smoke coming from it,” said Siqi Li, 22, a Hunter College student from Manhattan. “It was tilting down toward the water I thought they were doing some sort of trick. I didn’t realize it at first but it was a plane crash.”</p>         <div class="ra-module">  <div class="ra-rotator"> <div class="ra-rotator-wrapper" data-tb-region="slider-7-2598738">         <figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemid="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Vintage-World-War-II-plane-crashes-in-Hudson-River-pilot-killed-New-York-Daily-News.jpg"><img srcset="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Vintage-World-War-II-plane-crashes-in-Hudson-River-pilot-killed-New-York-Daily-News.jpg 750w, http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2652715.1464394979!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_1200/article-plane-0527-4.jpg 1200w" alt="A plane has landed in the hudson approx. near 79th early Friday evening, May 27, 2016." src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Vintage-World-War-II-plane-crashes-in-Hudson-River-pilot-killed-New-York-Daily-News.jpg"/><figcaption><h2 class="ra-caption" itemprop="description">A plane has landed in the hudson approx. near 79th early Friday evening, May 27, 2016.</h2>   <span class="ra-credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(@robflash_ via Twitter)</span>  </figcaption></figure><figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemid="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1464413526_424_Vintage-World-War-II-plane-crashes-in-Hudson-River-pilot-killed-New-York-Daily-News.jpg"><img srcset="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1464413526_424_Vintage-World-War-II-plane-crashes-in-Hudson-River-pilot-killed-New-York-Daily-News.jpg 750w, http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2652714.1464394934!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_1200/article-plane-0527-3.jpg 1200w" alt="A plane has landed in the hudson approx. near 79th early Friday evening, May 27, 2016." src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1464413526_424_Vintage-World-War-II-plane-crashes-in-Hudson-River-pilot-killed-New-York-Daily-News.jpg"/><figcaption><h2 class="ra-caption" itemprop="description">A plane has landed in the hudson approx. near 79th early Friday evening, May 27, 2016.</h2>   <span class="ra-credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(@AjayNN1 via Twitter)</span>  </figcaption></figure><figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemid="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1464413526_457_Vintage-World-War-II-plane-crashes-in-Hudson-River-pilot-killed-New-York-Daily-News.jpg"><img srcset="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1464413526_457_Vintage-World-War-II-plane-crashes-in-Hudson-River-pilot-killed-New-York-Daily-News.jpg 750w, http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2652709.1464395050!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_1200/article-plane-0527.jpg 1200w" alt="A plane has landed in the hudson approx. near 79th early Friday evening, May 27, 2016." src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1464413526_457_Vintage-World-War-II-plane-crashes-in-Hudson-River-pilot-killed-New-York-Daily-News.jpg"/><figcaption><h2 class="ra-caption" itemprop="description">A plane has landed in the hudson approx. near 79th early Friday evening, May 27, 2016.</h2>   <span class="ra-credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(@RealAJBetts via Twitter)</span>  </figcaption></figure><span class="ra-rotator-prev"/> <span class="ra-rotator-next"/> </div>  <span class="ra-rotator-enlarge"/> </div> </div>          &#13;

	The man at the controls of the doomed single engine plane was 56-year-old Bill Gordon, multiple sources said.</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	The experienced pilot, originally from upstate Copake, in Columbia County, had spent years as the Chief Pilot of the Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome and had recently flown in a show near his new home in Key West, Florida.</p>                                                                           <div class="ra-module h" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemid="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1464413526_426_Vintage-World-War-II-plane-crashes-in-Hudson-River-pilot-killed-New-York-Daily-News.jpg">

	Gordon was pulled from the plane around three hours later, police sources said.</p>&#13;

	Carla Nager was standing on her terrace at an apartment complex in Edgewater, N.J., with her husband when she heard “a sputtering” that sounded like an engine stalling.</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;

	Najam said he sensed something was wrong as the craft circled for almost 30 minutes.</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	“There was a lot of helicopter traffic, but he was doing nothing to avoid them,” Najam said. “In fact they were trying to get out of his way.”</p>        &#13;
<p>&#13;
	The plane was submerged in a matter of seconds, witnesses said.</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	The FDNY were able to tether a rope to the plane after they arrived, according to officials. The craft was on the river bottom in about 20 feet of water.</p>        &#13;
<p>&#13;
	Despite earlier reports by the New Jersey State Police, the pilot was unable to escape, said NYPD Deputy Chief Rodney Harrison.</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	A man who was pulled from the water and hospitalized was a swimmer who may have been trying to aid the rescue, sources said.</p>        &#13;
