<p>With camera trucks parked outside and wall-to-wall coverage on cable TV, Hillary Clinton hosted Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren for more than hour at her stately brick home in Washington, D.C.</p> 
<p>Cameras captured Warren exiting a blue SUV with legislative director Jon Donenberg and heading into Clinton’s Whitehaven residence Friday morning, more than an hour before Clinton was scheduled to deliver remarks at the Planned Parenthood Action Fund.<br/><b> </b><br/>The confab came a day after Warren, a progressive firebrand and outspoken Donald Trump critic, endorsed the former secretary of state and blasted Trump as "thin-skinned" during a legal forum near the White House.</p><p class="story-continued">Story Continued Below</p>

 <p>“I'm ready to get in this fight and work my heart out for Hillary Clinton to become the next president of the United States and to make sure that Donald Trump never gets anyplace close to the White House,” Warren told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow.</p>
<p>“Proud to have the support of @SenWarren — a woman who is Trump's exact opposite: honest, decent, and deeply concerned for working families,” Clinton wrote in a signed tweet she sent at 12:20 a.m. Friday.</p>
<p>Amid growing speculation that Clinton could name Warren as her vice presidential pick — creating a historic two-woman ticket — Clinton told POLITICO on Thursday that she has the highest regard for Warren, calling her “eminently qualified for any role,” including vice president.<br/><b> </b><br/>Warren expressed confidence that she could do the job, asserting to Maddow that she has the capacity to be commander-in-chief — the role a vice president would assume upon either the president’s death, resignation or removal.</p>
<p>Warren left Clinton’s home around 11:45 a.m. without addressing any reporters. She was seen laughing as she left the house and smiling as she got into a Ford Escape Hybrid. As the two spoke privately, the discussion among Democrats outside the residence was the consensus that Warren would be a great running mate for Clinton.</p><aside class="story-related ">

    </aside><p>Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ lone Senate backer, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, gushed over the prospect of a Vice President Warren, casting her as a progressive who could continue what Sanders started.</p>
<p>“Right now, Kate, every progressive in America is hoping that the conversation at Secretary Clinton’s house is all about how Elizabeth Warren would be a wonderful vice president of the United States,” he told CNN’s Kate Bolduan. </p>
<p>Merkley wasn’t as enthusiastic about Clinton but maintained that he “absolutely” supports her as the nominee.</p>
<p>“What I really want to see is success in November, and that means bringing together the two halves of the party. And one way to do that is through great policies that resonated so passionately in the grassroots,” he said. “Bring them into the campaign. Weed them into the convention. Make them part of the DNA of the presidential campaign that Secretary Clinton wages. There's multiple ways to do that through what Secretary Clinton herself as nominee says and pitches and also in this selection of a vice president.” </p>
<p>House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer told MSNBC that he doesn’t know whether Warren is interested but argued that she’s probably on Clinton’s shortlist and is “certainly qualified” to be vice president.</p>
<p>“I think that there are number of very, very good candidates — Sherrod Brown, Tom Perez, Tim Kaine, just to name a few, Joaquin Castro. There are a lot of good people out there,” the Maryland Democrat said. “But there’s no doubt that Elizabeth Warren does energize a large number of Americans because she’s focused, as Hillary Clinton is focused, on making sure that they are lifted up and that they get a piece of the rock, if you will, and that they make it in our country.”</p>
<p>Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who reignited the left when he ran for president in 2004 but endorsed Clinton in the primary, told POLITICO, "I think Elizabeth is absolutely qualified and would be a great pick." </p>
<p>But he added that he was hoping Clinton would instead choose "someone under 50. We need to think about transitioning the leadership of our country to the next generation."</p>
<p>Former California Rep. Henry Waxman said he had a “very high regard” for Warren’s abilities, particularly on domestic and economic issues, hailing Warren as someone who is “very brilliant in terms of economic issues.”</p>
<p>“I think she has so many leadership qualities. I think she would do a good job whatever opportunity came her way,” he told POLITICO. “I think she would be qualified to be president. But if I were to support her, I would want to know a lot more about her views on a whole range of issues, particularly foreign policy.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey also announced his support for Warren.</p>
<p>“I've served w/ her &amp; know she's absolutely qualified to be potus,” he tweeted, a seeming rebuttal to former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell's remark earlier in the week that Warren is "not in any way, shape, or form ready to be commander in chief.”</p>
<p>Clinton will host a dinner Friday night with some of her top fundraisers, during which she’s expected to recap her protracted primary campaign against Sanders and preview her general election campaign against Trump.</p>
