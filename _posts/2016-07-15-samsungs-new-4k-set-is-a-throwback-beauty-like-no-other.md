<br><div id=""><p>Today’s television sets are wonderful to look at, even when they’re off. But unless you live in a space station, they may look out of place in your home.</p>
<p>With Samsung’s new Serif TV, designer brothers Erwan and Ronan Bouroullec looked to the past instead for design cues. Drawing inspiration from the wooden-cabinet consoles of yore, they set out to design a set that blends, not stands out. <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/12/the-most-cleverly-designed-objects-of-2015/#slide-20" target="_blank">The Serif</a> isn’t a complete throwback, but a modern rethinking of the TV as furniture.</p>
<figure id="attachment_2058323" class="carve wp-caption portrait alignnone fader relative" data-js="fader"><img class="size-default-top-art wp-image-2058323" src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Samsungs-New-4K-Set-Is-a-Throwback-Beauty-Like-No-Other.jpg" alt="SamsungTV6.jpg" width="582" height="682"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text link-underline"><span class="credit link-underline-sm"><span aria-hidden="true" class="ui ui ui-photo inline-block ui-credit relative opacity-6 marg-r-sm marg-l-sm no-caption"/>Samsung</span></figcaption></figure><p>Having previously designed chairs, tables, and <a href="https://www.ligne-roset.com/us/modele/living/sofas/ploum" target="_blank">an absurdly comfortable couch</a>, the Bouroullec brothers said their inexperience with TVs helped them create something unique. “When you’re young and doing a new subject, you’re possibly going to make many errors,” says Erwan. “But you’re also possibly going to discover a new direction. There’s a lot of rules, and you don’t know them. You work through them without even knowing.”</p>
<p>From the edges of the set, it’s easy to see where “Serif” came from. The 40-inch TV resembles a bold, capital “I” from the side. Erwan says that wasn’t the intent going in, it just turned out that way. They felt the name was a perfect fit.</p>
<p>The frame, available in white and a blue so dark it’s practically black, isn’t the only part of the TV designed by the French brothers. The motion-controlled remote, cable-management system, and UI are all vastly different from anything else made by Samsung. (The latter is still built atop <a href="https://www.tizen.org/">Tizen</a>, though.)</p>
<p>The set’s cable-management system, for instance, is revealed when you pop off the TV’s magnetically attached, fabric-coated back panel. A groove in the back of the set runs the power and HDMI cables parallel to the TV’s slender legs, and a leg attachment lets you bundle them together. With a bit of cable-finessing and the right outlet layout, the TV <em>almost</em> looks like a wireless panel.</p>
<p>There’s a unique screensaver feature, dubbed Curtain Mode. It obscures what’s behind it with a sheer overlay, mimicking translucent drapes. You can tweak the color and opacity.</p>
<p>Unlike the international Serif TV lineup released last year in Europe and South Korea, the new US offering consists of one size and price: A 40-incher for $1,500. And while the specs aren’t entirely in line with Samsung’s top-end SUHD series, they’re still pretty good. This is a 4K TV with Samsung’s high-end HDR capabilities, even if 40 inches won’t do all those pixels justice. But even if the picture doesn’t look better, the console certainly does.</p>
