									<span class="marg-r-sm">It might look like an icy bird floating in space, but it’s actually the planetary nebula Hen 2-437, one of around 3,000 similar objects residing in the Milky Way. It occurs when an aging low-mass star reaches the final stages of life. The star swells to become a red giant, before casting off its gaseous layers into space. It then shrinks to form a white dwarf, while the expelled gas is slowly compressed and pushed outwards by stellar winds. While nebulas come in all different shapes, Hen 2-436 is a biopolar nebula as evidenced by the two blue lobes streaming outward from the center.</span><span class="credit"><span aria-hidden="true" role="presentation" class="ui ui-photo inline-block ui-credit relative opacity-5 marg-r-micro "/> <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/goddard/2016/hubble-watches-the-icy-blue-wings-of-hen-2-437">ESA, Hubble &amp; NASA</a></span>								</p>
