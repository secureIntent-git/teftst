The same judge rejected in December the state's request for a restraining order saying the evidence presented was "largely speculative hearsay."</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>"The Court does not deny that the Syrian refugees pose some risk. That would be foolish," Godbey wrote in the decision. "In our country, however, it is the federal executive that is charged with assessing and mitigating that risk, not the states and not the courts."    </p><span id="midArticle_3"/>
