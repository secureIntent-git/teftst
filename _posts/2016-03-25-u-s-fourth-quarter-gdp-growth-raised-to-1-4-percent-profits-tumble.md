<span class="focusParagraph" readability="3"><p>WASHINGTON - U.S. economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter, but not as sharply as previously</p></span><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>estimated, with fairly strong consumer spending offsetting the drag from efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory overhang.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Gross domestic product increased at a 1.4 percent annual rate instead of the previously reported 1.0 percent pace, the Commerce Department said on Friday in its third GDP estimate.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>GDP growth was initially estimated to have risen at only a 0.7 percent rate. The economy grew at a rate of 2.0 percent in the third quarter and expanded 2.4 percent for all of 2015.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Economists polled by Reuters had expected that fourth-quarter GDP growth would be unrevised at a 1.0 percent rate.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The upward revisions reflected a stronger pace of consumer spending than previously estimated. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose at a 2.4 percent pace rather than the 2.0 percent rate reported last month. That reflected more consumption of services than previously estimated.  </p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The fairly solid pace of consumer spending underscores the economy's underlying strength and should further allay fears of a recession, which triggered a massive stock market sell-off early this year. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Spending is being supported by a tightening labor market, which is steadily lifting wages, and rising house prices. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Gasoline prices around $2 per gallon are also helping to underpin household discretionary spending. </p><span id="midArticle_9"/>

Still, inventories remain high relative to domestic demand.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Businesses accumulated $78.3 billion worth of inventory rather than the $81.7 billion reported last month. As a result, inventories subtracted 0.22 percentage point from GDP growth instead of the previously reported 0.14 percentage point.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>First-quarter GDP growth estimates are around a 1.5 percent rate. But with the inventory pile still large and shipments of capital goods ordered by businesses weak in January and February, the risks to growth are tilted to the downside. </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>There was some bad news in the GDP report, with corporate profits falling for a second straight quarter as a strong dollar and cheap oil undercut the earnings of multi-national companies.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Profits after tax with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments declined at an annual rate of 8.4 percent, the biggest drop since the first quarter of 2014, after</p><span id="midArticle_14"/>
