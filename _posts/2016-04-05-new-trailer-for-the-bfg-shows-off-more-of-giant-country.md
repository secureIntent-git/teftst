<p>The first <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/12/the-bfg-trailer/" target="_blank">teaser</a> for Steven Spielberg’s adaptation of Roald Dahl’s classic book <em>The BFG</em> was just that—a big (friendly) tease. But now we have a full-length trailer, which shows off more of the visual effects and delves into the movie’s central relationship. Newly minted Academy Award-winner Mark Rylance plays the title role, a giant gifted with unnaturally good hearing and speed who delivers good dreams to children. The BFG smuggles away Sophie (newcomer Ruby Barnhill), a lonely orphan, to giant country, where they embark on an adventure to protect humans from the larger giants, like Bloodbottler (Bill Hader) and Flushlumpeater (Jemaine Clement). This full trailer thankfully doesn’t give away too much of the overall plot, mostly revealing the BFG and his friendship with Sophie. But it does go so far as to introduce the antagonists—larger, dangerous giants who make the BFG as much of an outcast in his world as Sophie feels in hers.</p>
<p><strong>Pause at:</strong> 0:49 to see some deft motion-capture work from Rylance, hiding in the shadows of a big city. 1:20 to see the BFG chopping his food, a wretched vegetable known as a snozzcumber. 1:45 for Sophie running around in what looks like Dream Country. 1:52 for the full reveal of the CGI work on the BFG’s face. 2:14 for the bigger, meaner giants, and what sounds like Clement’s voice as their leader.</p>
