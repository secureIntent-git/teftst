					<p>One of the most exciting things about the coming age of <a href="http://www.wired.com/tag/autonomous-vehicles/">autonomous driving</a> is all the ways it will <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/03/crazy-self-driving-racing-series-deserves-crazy-car/">free designers from constraints</a> like forward-facing seats, a steering wheel, and the need to pay attention. Connected car company Harman and automotive design firm Rinspeed explore this new freedom in the questionably named “Σtos” concept, envisioning what cars might look like when a human driver becomes a thing of the past.</p>
