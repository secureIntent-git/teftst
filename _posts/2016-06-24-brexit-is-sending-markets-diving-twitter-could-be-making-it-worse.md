<br><div id=""><p>The fate of the global economy is in doubt today following the United Kingdom’s decision to exit the European Union. Last night the British pound fell to a 30-year low. Prime Minister David Cameron is <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/6/24/12023376/brexit-david-cameron-resign" target="_blank">resigning</a>. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-36618560" target="_blank">called the referendum</a> “the most significant, near-term domestic risk to financial stability.” This morning, within the first five minutes of trading, the Dow fell more than 500 points. </p>
<p>But long before all the votes were tallied—and years before officials finish negotiating the terms of the UK’s departure—Twitter had reached a consenus on the Brexit: This is a disaster.</p>

<p>And the consequences may well be that bad. Uncertainty has never been a friend to global markets, and uncertainty is just what Brexit creates in heaps, particularly for the British economy. But like never before, social media has the ability to amplify the angst that uncertainty creates. And the markets may well be responding to that enhanced anxiety.</p>
<p data-js="fader" class="pullquote carve fader">
	There is a very real phenomenon of so-called 'mood contagion' that happens online.	<span class="attribution"/>
</p>

<p>To be clear, the social media masses aren’t the only ones predicting economic doom as a result of the Brexit. In an op-ed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/20/brexit-crash-pound-living-standards-george-soros" target="_blank">unsubtly headlined</a> “The Brexit crash will make all of you poorer—be warned,” billionaire George Soros argued that a plunging British pound would make the country far more vulnerable to an economic crash than it was at the time of the global recession in 2008.</p>
<p>The markets are certainly responding to such admonitions. But mounting research shows that a feedback loop does exist between social media and the stock markets, in which online anxieties about the market’s response may feed into the response itself. </p>
<p>“As soon as the market starts to drop, that affects the mood, it affects public sentiment, which then gets amplified online,” says Johan Bollen, a scientist who studies social media and markets at the Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing. “It’s not completely unthinkable there might be a self-fulfilling prophecy effect.”</p>
<p>After the stock market crash of 2008, Bollen <a href="http://www.wired.com/2010/10/twitter-crystal-ball/" target="_blank">analyzed nearly 10 million tweets</a> from that year. He found that when the level of panic rose on Twitter, the Dow would drop three or four days later. Bollen built an algorithm that predicted moves in the market accurately nearly 87 percent of the time when it factored in mood. The algorithm was only a little more than 73 percent accurate when it considered just the history of fluctuations in the Dow.</p>

</p>

<p>More recently, investors have begun integrating social media sentiment into their decision-making. Now, companies like <a href="https://www.dataminr.com/products/" target="_blank">Dataminr</a> help surface rumors as they arise on social media, which then drive investors’ plans.  </p>
<p>So, is this a bad thing?  Is it a way for investors to anticipate emotional responses and correct for them? Or does social media sentiment promote overreactions spawned by so many tweeters spinning each other into a panic? What we do know is that so-called “mood contagion” is a very real phenomenon online, as <a href="http://m.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full" target="_blank">studies of Facebook</a> and <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0142390" target="_blank">Twitter</a> have both found. We can catch each other’s feelings just like we could a virus. </p>
<p>Bollen cautions that it’s still unclear whether these effects are exacerbating the Brexit-induced volatility in the markets today. Either way, this uncertainty won’t go away any time soon. To move forward with the Brexit, the British government must invoke Article 50 of the EU’s Treaty to set in motion negotiations for the country’s departure. Those are then likely to take years, and the ultimate terms will keep investors guessing. </p>
<p>The EU has urged the UK to begin the negotiations “as soon as possible,” but Prime Minister Cameron plans to leave the duty of negotiations to the next Prime Minister after he resigns <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/6/24/12023376/brexit-david-cameron-resign" target="_blank">as early as October</a>,. As both the UK and the US prepare to elect new leaders, expect even more volatility to come—online and off.</p>
