"They were asking questions relative to the incident that happened on Sunday."</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>U.S. officials, who have also interviewed Mateen's wife, have said they do not believe he was assisted from abroad in the attack, which also wounded 53 people. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Meanwhile, funerals and memorials were held around Florida and in Puerto Rico - home to many of the people killed. Mourners hugged and wept after the burial of Kimberly Morris, 37, in Kissimmee, Florida, and family members of Angel Candelario-Padro, 28, embraced after his body returned to his hometown of Guanica, Puerto Rico.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer told reporters he would go to the funerals that families asked him to attend. "I will ask the community to do the same ... These are private ceremonies, people are hurting," he said.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Kenneth Feinberg, the lawyer who helped administer compensation funds for victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington and the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, is flying in to Orlando to advise the cityâ€™s OneOrlando Fund, which has already raised $7.5 million, Dyer said.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>"There are victims in need of support now, and we ask for your patience as we ensure we are able to assist these victims in an open, transparent and equitable manner," Dyer said. </p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Separately, the National Compassion Fund, a unit of the nonprofit National Center for Victims of Crime, was tapped on Thursday by gay rights group Equality Florida, to distribute the roughly $5 million raised online for the victims.

        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>President Barack Obama, who met survivors of the shooting and families of the dead in Orlando on Thursday, urged Congress to pass measures to make it harder to legally acquire high-powered weapons like the semi-automatic rifle used in the attack.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Mateen carried out the slaughter with the rifle and a handgun that had been legally purchased although he had twice been investigated in the past by the FBI for possible connections with militant Islamist groups.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Congress is under pressure to respond. The Senate is expected to vote on Monday on four proposals for limited gun restrictions, although all four are expected to fail. A group of Republican senators attempted on Friday to craft compromise legislation that might stand a better chance of passing.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><span id="midArticle_14"/><p> (Additional reporting by Carlos Barria in Kissimmee, Florida, Alvin Baez in Guanica, Puerto Rico and Zachary Fagenson in West Palm Beach, Florida; Writing by Scott Malone; Editing by Frances Kerry and Mary Milliken)</p><span id="midArticle_15"/></div>
