<br><p>"My name is death to traitors, freedom for Britain," Tommy Mair said when asked his name in the dock. </p><p>Mair was not required to enter a plea and the judge did not ask for one. Keith Allen, his attorney, said there was no indication of what plea would be entered.</p><p>Deputy Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot ordered Mair to be remanded in custody until his next appearance</p><p>Mair, 52,  is accused of killing Cox, a member of Britain's Parliament, in a brazen attack Thursday in her district in northern England. She was stabbed and shot on a Birstall street after a meeting with her constituents. </p><div readability="110.30017391304"><p>Police said the suspect had been charged with murder, grievous bodily harm, possession of a firearm with intent to commit an indictable offense and possession of an offensive weapon. </p><p>Authorities are also investigating whether Mair, who was arraigned Saturday, had ties to right-wing extremism. Details have begun to emerge about his interests in white supremacist and pro-apartheid groups. </p><p>West Yorkshire police said investigators are pursuing possible links to right-wing extremism, which police called a "priority line of enquiry which will help us establish the motive for the attack on Jo." </p><p><h3>Why was Cox targeted?</h3></p><p>Cox, a 41-year-old mother of two, was an avid campaigner for the rights of refugees. Her death comes a week before the so-called Brexit, a crucial referendum on whether Britain should stay in the European Union. She was an open supporter of remaining in the bloc.</p><p>Cox championed the rights of immigrants and in one of her last posts on social media, she said while immigration "is a legitimate concern," it's not a good reason for Britain to leave the EU. </p><p>One witness near the crime scene  Thursday, said the gunman shouted "Put Britain first" several times before and after the shooting, the Press Association reported.</p><div class="zn-body__paragraph" readability="24.391304347826">The killing has muted the tone of public discussions over the referendum, which has <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/16/europe/brexit-britain-immigration-referendum/index.html">focused heavily on immigration</a>. </div><p><h3>Police explore Mair's ties to white supremacist group</h3></p><div class="el__embedded el__embedded--standard"><div class="el__image--standard js__image--standard"><div readability="6.5"><img class="media__image media__image--responsive" alt="Tommy Mair has been detained, according to the Press Association." data-src-mini="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160617110243-thomas-mair-tommy-cox-suspect-small-169.jpg" data-src-xsmall="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160617110243-thomas-mair-tommy-cox-suspect-medium-plus-169.jpg" data-src-small="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Jo-Cox-attack-Murder-suspect-gives-name-as-039death-to-traitors039-in-court-CNN.jpg" data-src-medium="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160617110243-thomas-mair-tommy-cox-suspect-exlarge-169.jpg" data-src-large="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160617110243-thomas-mair-tommy-cox-suspect-super-169.jpg" data-src-full16x9="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160617110243-thomas-mair-tommy-cox-suspect-full-169.jpg" data-src-mini1x1="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160617110243-thomas-mair-tommy-cox-suspect-small-11.jpg" data-demand-load="not-loaded" data-eq-pts="mini: 0,  xsmall: 221,  small: 308,  medium: 461,  large:  781" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7"/><noscript><img alt="Tommy Mair has been detained, according to the Press Association." class="media__image" src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Jo-Cox-attack-Murder-suspect-gives-name-as-039death-to-traitors039-in-court-CNN.jpg"/></noscript></div></div></div><p>Police said in a statement that the incident "appears to be an isolated, but targeted attack." </p><p>Authorities are also investigating how the suspect got a firearm and are looking into his mental health. </p><div class="zn-body__paragraph" readability="30.023166023166">Mair may have had an interest in white supremacist groups, according to the U.S.-based <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2016/06/16/alleged-killer-british-mp-was-longtime-supporter-neo-nazi-national-alliance" target="_blank">Southern Poverty Law Center which published</a> what it says are documents showing his history of purchasing material from the National Alliance white supremacist organization. </div><p>The center released copies of receipts and a 2013 subscription to the National Alliance's publication National Vanguard as well as receipts from 1999 showing purchases for neo-Nazi book "Ich Kampfe," the "Improvised Munitions Handbook" and other books. </p><p>Mair also subscribed to a pro-apartheid group's magazine in the 1980s.</p><p>"A Mr. Thomas A.

He kept to himself most of the time, but he engaged in conversations with neighbors when they spoke to him, they said.</p><p>Mair had lived in the house for a long time, one neighbor said.
