        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The move follows a series of high-profile hacks against the government and companies like Sony Pictures and Target, that were largely met with legislative inaction and administrative uncertainty on how best to address evolving cyber threats.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Those difficulties played out publicly last year when the Office of Personnel Management announced it had fallen victim to a massive hack that lifted sensitive information on roughly 22 million individuals from its databases. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The White House will also announce Tuesday plans for a presidential commission on cyber security, which will make recommendations on how to strengthen defenses over the next decade. Officials, who briefed reporters before the formal release of the Obama budget, said they would create a new position of federal chief information security officer. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>A government watchdog report last month concluded that the government’s cyber defense system, known as Einstein, is ineffective at combating hackers.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>“No matter how good we get, we will never stop 100 percent of intrusions” Michael Daniel, special assistant to the president and cybersecurity coordinator, told reporters in the briefing before the release of the budget plan.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Obama will also sign an executive order Tuesday to create a permanent Federal Privacy Council, which aims to connect privacy officials across the government to develop comprehensive guidelines for how personal data is collected and stored.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>The president’s budget proposal will also call for $62 million to expand efforts to attract and retain qualified cyber professionals working for the government, with things like student loan forgiveness and the creation of a CyberCorps Reserve program, where Americans can obtain college scholarships if they pursue technical jobs in government. </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><p> (Reporting by Dustin Volz; Editing by <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=richard.cowan&amp;">Richard Cowan</a> and Andrew Hay)</p><span id="midArticle_14"/></div>
