In the wake of the 30-minute conversation between the former president and the attorney general becoming public, Lynch announced that she would accept whatever course the FBI recommended regarding Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Comey was at pains Tuesday to insist that there had been no political pressure placed on the bureau he leads.</p><p>At the outset of his statement, he said that he had “not coordinated or reviewed this statement in any way with the Department of Justice or any other part of government. They do not know what I am about to say.”</p><p>He closed with an assertion that the FBI had worked in “an entirely apolitical” way. </p><p>“What I can assure the American people is that this investigation was done competently, honestly and independently,” he said. “No outside influence of any kind was brought to bear.”</p><p>Some experts argued that Comey had walked the high wire as steadily as could be reasonably expected.</p><p>“I think very highly of him. He is an incredibly thoughtful, experienced person. He is the right guy to have. I don’t think he was fazed by the politics,” said Ron Hosko, president of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund and a former assistant director of the FBI.</p><p>But Hosko also hinted that he himself had been surprised that the harsh criticism Comey leveled at Clinton did not lead to a recommendation to indict.</p><p>Referring to Comey’s Tuesday morning remarks, he said, “For the first three-quarters of it, he was crafting an indictment of Hillary Clinton’s actions. … It felt like an indictment.”</p><p>While Comey would deny any balancing of political imperatives, it is nonetheless a fact that his decision to not press for indictment was accompanied by several damning findings — most notably that Clinton and her colleagues had been “extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.”</p><p>Referring to email exchanges that included classified information, Comey also asserted, “There is evidence to support a conclusion that any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton’s position … should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation.”</p><p>If those findings provided some welcome ammunition for Clinton’s foes, they also drew protests from some quarters.</p><p>Matt Miller, who served as a Department of Justice spokesman during <span class="rollover-people"><a class="rollover-people-link" data-nid="188153" href="http://thehill.com/people/eric-holder">Eric Holder</a><span class="rollover-people-block" id="rollover-people-188153"><span class="rollover-block"><span><img typeof="foaf:Image" src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/1467800592_259_Defining-moment-for-Comey-in-Clinton-call-The-Hill.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt=""/><a class="name" href="http://thehill.com/people/eric-holder">Eric H.
