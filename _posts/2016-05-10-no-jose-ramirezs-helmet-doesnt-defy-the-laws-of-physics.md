<br><div id=""><p>The Internet loves a great video. In today’s clip we see José Ramírez of the Cleveland Indians sliding into second base. But wait! His hat (I’m calling it a hat not a helmet because no one has a magic helmet) falls off and hits his foot. Magically, the hat appears to fly both backward and still end up hitting Ramírez on the back as he reaches second base.</p>
<p>Of course it’s not really a magic hat. In fact, this is actually an excellent demonstration of some basic physics. First, let me give a simple explanation of what happened.</p>
<ul><li>Ramírez kicks the hat. Yes, the hat is going fairly fast, but we can treat it as a plain old object with projectile motion (negligible air resistance).</li>
<li>The hat gets kicked both up and forward. After leaving his foot, the hat travels in a parabolic path towards second base where it collides with Ramírez.</li>
<li>Here is the magic part. The camera follows Ramírez. This gives the illusion that the hat is kicked <em>backwards</em> even though it isn’t.</li>
</ul><p>Now I have two short animations to show that this illusion is caused by the camera. First, I have a short clip in which I corrected for the motion of the camera (this isn’t too difficult to accomplish using <a href="http://physlets.org/tracker/">Tracker Video Analysis</a>).</p>

<p>Here is the second clip. This shows the same event but from a different camera.</p>

<h3>Projectile Motion Physics</h3>
<p>I can’t just explain the magic and then stop. No, I am legally required to include some physics. Actually, this is a great example of a property of projectile motion that shows the vertical and horizontal motions are independent of each other (if there is no air resistance).</p>
<p>Let me start with a classic physics demonstration. This one is called the Howitzer cart. Basically, it’s a rolling cart that shoots a ball vertically upward (in the reference frame of the cart). Here is what that looks like.</p>
<figure attachment_2016980="" class="wp-caption landscape alignnone fader relative" data-js="fader"><a href="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1462908969_885_No-Jose-Ramirezs-Helmet-Doesnt-Defy-the-Laws-of-Physics.gif"><img class="size-200-100-thumbnail wp-image-2016980" src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1462908969_885_No-Jose-Ramirezs-Helmet-Doesnt-Defy-the-Laws-of-Physics.gif" alt="howitzercart.gif" width="200" height="100"/></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text link-underline"><span class="credit link-underline-sm"><span aria-hidden="true" class="ui ui ui-photo inline-block ui-credit relative opacity-6 marg-r-sm marg-l-sm no-caption"/>Rhett Allain</span></figcaption></figure><p>Here is the key to this demo. When the ball leaves the launcher, it has the same horizontal velocity as the cart. Since neither the ball nor the the cart have a significant force in the horizontal direction, their positions at each instant of time are the same. This means that when the ball gets back down to the height of the cart, it lands right back into the launcher.</p>
<p>Really, this is one of the key aspects of solving problems with projectile motion—treat the x and y-motions separately except for the time it takes. Typically you will use either the horizontal or vertical motion to solve for time and then use that in the other dimension.</p>
<p>OK, one more thing about the Ramírez helmet kick. It’s very unlikely that he kicked the hat such that it had the same horizontal velocity that he had. The hat still hits him on the head at second base because Ramírez didn’t have a constant velocity. Instead, he was sliding and stopping: This allows the hat to catch up to him before hitting the ground. But still, wouldn’t this have been awesome if the helmet actually landed back on his head as though he was wearing it?</p>
