Soldiers were also fighting on a southern front, he said.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Syrian media and Arab television channels broadcasting from the slopes of Palmyra's medieval citadel, one of the last areas of high ground seized by the army on Friday, said troops had advanced inside Palmyra and had taken several neighborhoods.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>The recapture of Palmyra, which the Islamist group seized in May 2015, would mark the biggest reversal for Islamic State in Syria since Russia's intervention turned the tide of the five-year conflict in President Bashar al-Assad's favor.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The group and al Qaeda's Syrian branch the Nusra Front are excluded from a month-long cessation of hostilities that has brought a lull in fighting between the government and rebels battling Assad in western Syria.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>The limited truce has allowed some aid deliveries to get to previously inaccessible areas under siege. The International Committee for the Red Cross said on Saturday it brought food and hygiene items to three areas of south Damascus the day before.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>

        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>RESTORING THE TEMPLES</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Palmyra had a population of 50,000 according to a census more than 10 years ago. Those numbers were swelled hugely by an influx of people displaced by Syria's conflict, which has raged since 2011, but most fled when Islamic State took over.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Recapturing the city would open up eastern Syria, where Islamic State controls most of the Euphrates Valley provinces of Deir al-Zor and Raqqa, to the army.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>"Our heroic forces are continuing to advance until we liberate every inch of this pure land," a soldier told state-run television in a broadcast from the slopes of the citadel, which overlooks the city's monumental ruins.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>In August, Islamic State fighters dynamited two ancient buildings, the temples of Bel and Baal Shamin, which had stood as cultural landmarks in Palmyra for nearly two millennia.
