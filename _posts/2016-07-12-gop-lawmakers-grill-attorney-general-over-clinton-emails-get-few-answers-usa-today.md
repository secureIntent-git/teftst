She said FBI Director James Comey — who said Hillary Clinton was “extremely careless” but should not be charged — has already provided more detailed information than is typical for a federal investigation.</p><p>And Lynch said the case was not influenced in any way by her 30-minute meeting with Bill Clinton, which occurred at his request on her government plane as the two were passing through Phoenix.</p><p>"I agreed to say hello," Lynch testified. "We had a social conversation."</p><p>Her refusal to elaborate on the legal basis incensed Republicans. Rep. Bob Goodlatte, Va., chairman of the Judiciary Committee, issued a statement while the hearing was still in progress accusing Lynch of “dodging any responsibility to be forthright to Congress by referring members to the statements of her subordinate.”</p><p>Goodlatte said she should have recused herself from the email probe entirely and appointed a special prosecutor, given her prior relationship with Bill Clinton. He appointed her in 1999 as the chief federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, N.Y.</p><p>“It’s equally troubling that she met privately with former President Clinton just days before FBI Director Comey announced that he does not recommend criminal charges be filed against Secretary Clinton," Goodlatte said. "The American people deserve transparency about this investigation.”</p><p>Goodlatte and House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, on Monday asked the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia <a href="http://Goodlatte%20and%20House%20Oversight%20Committee%20Chairman%20Jason%20Chaffetz%20on%20Monday%20asked%20the%20U.S.%20Attorney%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia%20to%20investigate%20whether%20Hillary%20Clinton%20lied%20to%20Congress%20in%20testimony%20about%20her%20email.">to investigate</a> whether Hillary Clinton lied to Congress in testimony about her email.</p><p>Democrats on the committee tried repeatedly to steer the hearing to questions about the spate of gun violence that has frayed community-police relations across the country. Following the videotaped shootings by police of two African-American men — Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota — a gunman in Dallas last week killed five police officers at a rally protesting the shootings.</p><p>"I have great respect for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, but we are in the midst of a gun violence epidemic here in America," said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said. He called the Republican-led hearing a "fishing expediton" and a ”reckless legislative joy ride” designed to "crash and burn."</p><p>Lynch’s department is investigating Sterling's death and could open a probe of Castile’s. She has made police-community relations a central issue of her tenure since being confirmed as the nation’s highest law enforcement official, the first African-American woman to hold the job.</p><p>Following the Dallas shootings, she said she was “heartbroken” and pledged her department would do everything it could to support law enforcement and to protect free speech and assembly rights of protesters. At Tuesday's hearing, she said that work would continue.</p><p>"As we grapple with the aftermath of these events, the Department of Justice will continue to do everything in our power to build bonds of trust and cooperation between law enforcement and the communities we serve," she said.</p><p>Two Illinois lawmakers wrote to Lynch on Friday urging her to work with them to craft federal policies that could help stem shootings by police. The Dallas shooter, Micah Xavier Johnson, told police he was upset by the shootings and wanted to kill white police officers.</p><p>“State by state, city by city, and county by county we might make this reform or that reform, but there is no national strategy to stop police from killing people – especially black people, especially black men,” wrote Democratic Reps. Robin Kelly and Luis Gutiérrez.</p><!-- cxenseparse_end --><p>Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/29KuGUE</p></div>
