<br><div id=""><p>The first day of April has, for generations, meant “Don’t believe anything you read.” In more recent years, it’s been expanded to add “… and <em>definitely</em> don’t believe anything you read online. Like, seriously.” This year, though, April Fools’ Day seems to be using the power of the Internet to expand its reach to encompass at least 48 hours. In addition to a ridiculous fake news report about a supermarket chain going out of business—we’ll get to that soon enough—there was also <a href="https://twitter.com/peta/status/715614896407187456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank">this</a> March 31 tweet from PETA about the effects of chicken on your baby’s anatomy. So, yes. This is the world we’re apparently living in these days. With that in mind, here are the highlights of what you might have missed in the last seven days of our lyin’, shameful World Wide Web. </p>
<h3>No One White Was in the Room Where It Happened</h3>
<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> When a call for non-white actors to appear in <em>Hamilton</em> was met with outrage, the outrage was met with counter-outrage. Because, you know, the Internet.<br/><strong>Where It Blew Up:</strong> Twitter, media think pieces<br/><strong>What <em>Really</em> Happened:</strong> The news that <a href="http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/03/29/hamilton-casting-call-non-white/">a New York attorney was considering</a> legal action against producers of <em>Hamilton</em> because of a casting call asking for “non-white” actors sounded like an April Fools’ Day joke from the future when it broke at the start of the week, but no. <a href="http://www.playbill.com/article/hamilton-producers-respond-to-casting-criticism">It was actually real</a>, with the complaint targeting the fact that the request might violate the New York City Human Rights Law banning hiring discrimination based on race.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/no-the-hamilton-casting-call-for-non-white-actors-is-not-reverse-racism_us_56fd2c83e4b0daf53aeed9b9">this</a> <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/2946009/hamilton-no-whites-need-apply-casting-call-deemed-racist/">kind</a> <a href="http://theblemish.com/2016/03/hamilton-got-too-good-so-a-bunch-of-people-called-it-racist/">of</a> <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/theater-arts/hamilton-hiring-practices-fire-due-discrimination-article-1.2582555">story</a> <a href="http://www.bet.com/news/celebrities/2016/03/31/you-won-t-believe-why-the-broadway-hit-hamilton-is-being-accused.html">is</a> <a href="http://www.glamour.com/inspired/blogs/the-conversation/2016/03/broadway-musical-hamilton-post">catnip</a> <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/03/hamilton-casting/476247/">for</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-35933861">media</a> <a href="http://www.people.com/article/hamilton-faces-backlash-wording-open-casting-call-sticks-with-commitment-to-diversity">coverage</a>, but it was, as you’d expect, Twitter that had the most honest reaction to the concept:</p>

<p> <br/><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> In the end, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/31/arts/union-criticizes-hamilton-casting-call-seeking-nonwhite-actors.html?_r=0">producers agreed to change the wording of the casting call</a>, but <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2016/03/hamilton-producer-responds-to-casting-outrage.html">also affirmed the fact</a> that <em>the entire purpose</em> of the show is to use a multicultural, non-white cast. “It is essential to the storytelling of <em>Hamilton</em> that the principal roles—which were written for non-white characters (excepting King George)—be performed by non-white actors,” a spokesperson explained. </p>
<h3>Well, That’s One Way to Go</h3>
<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> What would be exactly the <em>wrong</em> way to respond to an attempt to shame and harass one of your employees? Those who said, “Terminate said employee,” clearly you don’t work for Nintendo.<br/><strong>Where It Blew Up:</strong> Twitter, blogs, media think pieces<br/><strong>What <em>Really</em> Happened:</strong> For those paying attention to the ongoing culture wars in gaming, the name Alison Rapp was likely already familiar before this week. By managing the one-two punch of working as a marketing specialist at Nintendo and being a woman, she was <a href="http://kotaku.com/the-ugly-new-front-in-the-neverending-video-game-cultur-1762942381">an obvious target</a> for those who like to harass women in gaming. Earlier this week, Rapp revealed on Twitter that the harassment attempts had been successful.</p>

<p>For what it’s worth, Nintendo <a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2016/03/30/controversy-erupts-over-nintendo-employees-termination.aspx">agreed that her firing wasn’t Gamergate related, releasing a statement that suggested another reason</a>: “Alison Rapp was terminated due to violation of an internal company policy involving holding a second job in conflict with Nintendo’s corporate culture,” the statement read. “Though Ms. Rapp’s termination follows her being the subject of criticism from certain groups via social media several weeks ago, the two are absolutely not related.” </p>
<p>Except, according to Rapp, there’s one problem with that.</p>

<p>It’s possible that, <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/03/31/media-twist-facts-in-nintendo-employee-alison-rapps-firing-to-promote-harassment-narrative/">as some GGer critics have since suggested</a>, Nintendo simply didn’t like the nature of her second job, but as Rapp pointed out, it was relatively anonymous, and something the company was unlikely to have known about if not for the harassment she went through:</p>

<p>Even though the original story ended with a “Ha ha, April Fools!” punchline, enough people didn’t actually read the story to the end to miss it that <a href="http://www.snopes.com/trader-joes-april-fools-day/">Snopes created an entry to debunk the report</a>. If there’s a moral to this story, it’s either “Don’t believe anything you read anytime in the last week of March, just in case morons are trying to be first in the Fool race,” or perhaps just “Yahoo!’s idea of a good time was poorly considered, at best.”<br/><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> Well, OK, there’s maybe <em>another</em> moral…</p>

<h3>The Monkey’s Cleavage</h3>
<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> The British newspaper <em>The Sun</em> asked for cleavage shots on Twitter in the name of… cheap sensationalism? Little did it know what it would get in return.<br/><strong>Where It Blew Up:</strong> Twitter<br/><strong>What <em>Really</em> Happened:</strong> Congratulations, Great British Public; your response to the ridiculous is still entirely appropriate, as can be seen in the way British Twitter reacted to this horrific tweet from the British <em>Sun</em> newspaper:</p>

We salute you nonetheless. </p>
<h3>What the <em>Elle</em>?</h3>
<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> How best to ensure that you never work in an industry again? Write an online piece claiming to reveal everything… including your own biases.<br/><strong>Where It Blew Up:</strong> Twitter, media think pieces<br/><strong>What <em>Really</em> Happened:</strong> All hail Jacques Hyzagi, a former writer for <em>Elle</em> who took to the Internet this week to share his frustrations with the magazine in <a href="http://observer.com/2016/03/elle-on-earth/">a spectacular tell-all</a> that didn’t just train its fire on his former bosses, but on modern journalism as a whole. (A sample piece: “I could hear the fascist and anti-Semite William Randolph Hearst turning in his grave. The Hearst perfume magazines, among them <em>ELLE, Harper’s Bazaar, Cosmo, Marie Claire, O</em> can thank for their survival the drug data company, First Data Bank—the credit rating agency Fitch Ratings (part of Fitch group) own at 80 percent by Hearst and the software company Homecare Homebase that bring in the bigger share of Hearst revenues. One can easily see why.”)</p>
<p>This kind of flame-out is something that only makes Twitter happy:</p>
