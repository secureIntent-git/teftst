"The question we have is do we have the votes to pass a budget? That's the conversation we're having with our members."</p><p>Ryan is trying to meet the April 15 statutory deadline for the House to pass a budget. That seems increasingly unlikely since the House is scheduled to adjourn Wednesday for Easter recess and not return until April 12.</p><p>So far, Ryan, the former Budget Committee chairman who became speaker five months ago, is struggling to convince the most conservative wing of his party to support spending levels that Republicans and Democrats agreed on in October. Former House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, resigned last fall in large part because he could not tame the rebellious Freedom Caucus' constant demand for deeper spending cuts.</p><p>The House Budget Committee last week approved a budget resolution that provides $1.07 trillion in discretionary spending for fiscal 2017. But Freedom Caucus members and some other conservatives want House leaders to scrap that deal and set the budget at no more than $1.04 trillion to comply with stricter spending levels set in the 2011 Budget Control Act.</p><p>"We're being asked to validate a spending level that the vast majority of the Republican Party opposed...a few months ago," said Rep. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo. To win her support, Lummis said, the budget has to reduce the deficit and address "the fiscal mess that we know exists."</p><p>Ryan tried to quash speculation Tuesday that the House will go ahead and pass individual spending bills for each federal agency even if it can't agree on a budget resolution to serve as a blueprint for that spending.</p><p>"No, we know we need to do a budget," Ryan said. He said the House Appropriations Committee is going to do "their spade work" on the individual spending bills so that they will be ready to go in May if the House passes a budget in April.</p><p>Meanwhile, Democrats chastised Republicans for their failure to agree on a budget.</p><p>"It is simply unconscionable that the House Republican leadership plans two weeks of recess without...passing a budget blueprint for next year,” Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi,D-Calif., said Monday.</p><p>Pelosi and other Democratic leaders said Ryan should cancel the recess unless the House passes a budget that includes emergency funding to combat the Zika virus and opioid addiction and to help Flint, Mich. deal with its lead-contaminated water crisis.</p><p>"House GOP plans to leave town for two weeks without voting on budget or addressing health crises," assistant Democratic leader James Clyburn of South Carolina tweeted Tuesday.</p><div id="module-position-O5nWPiYMOP0" class="story-asset oembed-asset"><div class="story-oembed-wrap "><div class="js-oembed story-oembed story-oembed-twitter story-oembed-type-rich" data-oembed-type="rich" data-oembed-provider="twitter" readability="18.967741935484"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" readability="3.6129032258065"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/HouseGOP">@HouseGOP</a> plans to leave town for 2 weeks w/out voting on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/budget?src=hash">#budget</a> or addressing health crises. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DoYourJobHouseGOP?src=hash">#DoYourJobHouseGOP</a><a href="https://t.co/Z4G6TTFpMJ">pic.twitter.com/Z4G6TTFpMJ</a></p>— James E.

He said the caucus typically would wait until April to discuss the budget, but he is trying to speed up the process because the House has a shortened calendar this year with the political conventions coming up in July and the elections in November.</p><p><em>Contributing: Jenny Ung</em></p><!-- cxenseparse_end --><p>Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1RiC2Iv</p></div>
