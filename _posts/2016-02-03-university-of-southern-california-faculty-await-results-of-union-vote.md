        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Provost Michael Quick, who opposes the unionization effort, said the university is offering higher salaries than the union has negotiated at other colleges, and offers benefits to any who work half-time. The university has also improved job security by offering multi-year contracts to those who are not on track for tenure, he said.    </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Like many private universities struggling as their endowments took a hit during the financial crisis, USC has relied more on part-time and contract faculty, and less on the relatively better paid professors who are on track to achieve full tenure, or lifetime employment.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>USC is the largest private employer in the city of Los Angeles, with 6,624 faculty members and about 25,000 jobs total. About 1,180 faculty have the lifetime protections of tenure, while another 315 are on track to receive the benefit, according to data provided by the university.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>But whereas star tenured professors can pull down six-figure salaries, adjunct lecturers at USC make between $3,840 and $10,000 per course they teach, according to the Adjunct Project, which tracks work issues for non-tenure professors.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
