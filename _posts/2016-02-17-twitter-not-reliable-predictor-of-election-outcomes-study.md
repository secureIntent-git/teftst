<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">NEW YORK</span> In politics, it is said that all press is good press. But that does not necessarily apply to tweets, according to a study released this week.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>In fact, it is difficult to predict the outcome of an election based on the amount of Twitter buzz a candidate gets, according to the study from the Social Science Computer Review.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The study, whose relevance to this year's U.S. election was sharply disputed by Twitter, focused on the 2013 German federal election and found that Twitter data was a more accurate measure of the level of interest in candidates rather than the level of support they will receive.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"Negative events, such as political scandals, as well as positively evaluated events, such as accomplishments, can (both)underlie attention for a party or candidate," said the study, published on Monday.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Yet scandals and accomplishments affect the level of support for a candidate in completely different ways.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"The analysis does not support the simple 'more tweets, more votes' formula," the study found. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>For example, a video clip of a candidate's campaign gaffe broadcast on the nightly news might lead to a spike in Twitter attention, but likely not result in more overall political support, according to the study.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>"The daily volume of Twitter messages referring to candidates or parties fluctuates heavily depending on the events of the day - such as televised leadersâ€™ debates, high-profile interviews with candidates - or the coverage of political controversies and scandals," the study said.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The data also showed that Twitter users did not necessarily reflect the demographics of the population as a whole. In the United States, social media platforms like Twitter and Yik Yak are often more popular among millennial voters.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>A Twitter spokesman argued the study was not relevant to the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>"I'd advise passing the next time someone sends along German Twitter data from three years ago in the context of the 2016 U.S. election," said Nick Pacilio, a spokesman for the social media site's government and news department.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Pacilio cited a Time magazine website report that showed Twitter chatter favored the winning candidates, Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump, in the Iowa caucuses this month.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Republican and Democratic contenders are vying for their parties' nominations for the Nov. 8 election to succeed President Barack Obama.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><span id="midArticle_14"/><p> (Reporting by Amy Tennery; Editing by Peter Cooney)</p><span id="midArticle_15"/></div>
