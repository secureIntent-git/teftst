That number has been repeatedly revised upward from initial estimates that were far smaller.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Comstock, in her statement, cited a Government Accountability Office report released last month that found the IRS struggling to upgrade its information security plan. The IRS agreed to work toward implementing dozens of outlined recommendations.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Koskinen appeared before congressional committees this week and said complying with the GAO recommendations was a priority.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The commissioner has been under near-constant fire from Republicans since he took over the agency in 2013 amid controversy over whether the IRS was targeting conservative groups. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>More than 60 Republicans have signed on to a resolution introduced in October to impeach Koskinen on charges that he has impeded a congressional investigation into the IRS's treatment of conservative groups.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Comstock is the first lawmaker to call for Koskinen's resignation solely for cyber security reasons, an aide said.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
