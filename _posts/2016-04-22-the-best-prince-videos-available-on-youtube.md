<br><div readability="16">
				<p>Prince's performance during the Super Bowl in 2007 will likely go down as the greatest halftime show ever. (No offense, Beyoncé.) And while it's not surprising that he did an amazing set, the fact that he did it during a downpour is pretty incredible. The conditions were abysmal, but following a medley of "Proud Mary," "All Along the Watchtower," and "Best of You," Prince launched into perhaps the most situationally appropriate rendition of "Purple Rain" of his career.</p>
