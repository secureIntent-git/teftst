				    			<p>Aside from the fact that <strong><a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/anne_hathaway">Anne Hathaway</a></strong> <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/502337/anne-hathaway-reveals-she-s-looking-forward-to-having-kids-soon-get-the-details" target="_blank">couldn't wait to start a family</a> and is going to be a <a href="http://www.vogue.com/865290/leap-of-faith-anne-hathaway/" target="_blank">loving parent</a>, there are a few other reasons as to why she couldn't be more prepared for motherhood.</p><p>To put it bluntly, there may be no one in Hollywood who's been put through more crap for no <em>real</em> reason than Hathaway—and the experience of having the greatest year of her career juxtaposed with being the subject of many a damning think piece had to have stiffened that spine of hers into a permanently unbreakable position.</p><p>And that can only help a woman navigate the roller-coaster journey that is motherhood.</p><p>As <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/747685/anne-hathaway-gives-birth-to-baby-boy-find-out-his-name" target="_blank">E! News was first to report</a>, Hathaway and husband <strong>Adam Shulman</strong> welcomed their first child together, son <strong><a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/755025/anne-hathaway-s-unique-baby-name-decoded-the-special-meaning-behind-jonathan-rosebanks" target="_blank">Jonathan Rosebanks Shulman</a></strong>, on March 24 in L.A., so we know that the proud parents are set adrift on cloud nine at the moment. And we can already picture Hathaway being an awesome, hands-on mom who won't stand idly by if her son is ever feeling less than loved, confident or special.</p><p>Because she'll know from experience that there's no point in paying too much attention to what other people think.</p>

				    			<p>We've all heard a parent rue the day or insist that they don't want us making the same mistakes they did. Usually it's annoying, but eventually we get where they're coming from.</p><p>Really, what better way to make the most of one's life experience than to turn anything unpleasant around into a positive life lesson for a little one?</p><p>First of all, she's going to kick ass at giving relationship advice. Before <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/593197/anne-hathaway-says-marriage-isn-t-what-she-expected-find-out-why" target="_blank">falling head over heels with her eventual husband</a>, Hathaway was infamously involved with an Italian real estate investor who ended up <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/326365/out-of-jail-anne-hathaway-s-con-man-ex-beau-opens-up-about-their-love-affair" target="_blank">serving prison time</a> for fraudulent business practices. So Hathaway now knows the difference between the frogs and the princes out there, and we're thinking a parent's willingness to let their kid make his or her own mistakes will only extend so far in her case.</p><p>Which is fine, because Mom is always right about these things (even if it takes a few years to realize it).</p>

Am I <em>too</em> thin? Is my body the right shape?'" she told <em>Glamour</em> in 2012. "There's an obsessive quality to it that I thought I would've grown out of by now.

"I didn't understand how you could be thin and strong. I went into the gym for 10 months and didn't come out."</p>

				    			<p>Moreover, to <em>Glamour</em> she also acknowledged that her skin historically tended to be on the thin side.</p><p>"I know it makes me sound weak, but rather than make myself happy and wear the silly hat and say, 'Oh, I don't care,' I actually really don't feel like getting made fun of," the actress said. "So I put on something boring and navy and go out and try to disappear."</p><p>Hathaway was describing issues that more people go through than not, at least at some point in life. And those like Hathaway who are obviously extremely self-aware, and who have experienced such insecurities, or irrational fear in general, often give the best advice—because they know they're being irrational, can relate and can confidently tell someone (such as their own child) to try not to worry and enjoy being himself.</p>

Exactly.</p><p>But the "oh, f--k it" embrace of who <em>she </em>is didn't come without a fight.</p><p>For entirely intangible reasons, Hathaway—beloved in <em>The Princess Diaries</em>, applauded in <em>The Devil Wears Prada </em>and appreciated for her commitment in films like <em>Brokeback Mountain </em>and <em>Rachel Getting Married</em>—was targeted by the authenticity police in 2013 during the time she was also scoring accolades right and left for her heartbreaking performance in <em>Les Misérables</em>.</p><p>So much so that by the time she won the Oscar (at least the Academy wasn't hating on her) for Best Supporting Actress, every word out of her mouth was being picked apart as too saccharine, too flowery, too calculated—or even too earnest.</p>

				    			<p>"I've realized that I don't need validation from anybody. At all," she also said in that interview. "I'm not sitting here now worrying, 'What do you think of me?' With all due respect, you seem like a lovely lady, but I don't need you, or anyone else, to like me. And that's so liberating. It's a big reveal, man."</p><p>With that sort of realization, especially one that came after such a public run-in with a merciless Internet, comes the wisdom that a mother best have at the ready on that inevitable day when her kid comes home from school and wonders how that other kid could say something so mean. </p><p>When that day comes, maybe Mom will show him her Oscar and tell him a little story.</p>
