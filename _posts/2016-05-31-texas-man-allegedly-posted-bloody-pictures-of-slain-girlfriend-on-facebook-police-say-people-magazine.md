		 </div><div id="articleBody" readability="96.693021529324">A 45-year-old man has been arrested by authorities in Texas for allegedly stabbing his girlfriend to death before logging onto her Facebook account to post gory photos of her body online, PEOPLE confirms.
<p>Court and <a href="https://apps.collincountytx.gov/JudicialRecords/Inmate/416915/Inmate|Search|Inmate%20Search%20Results|Amyx|1" target="_blank">inmate</a> records obtained by PEOPLE indicate Kenneth Alan Amyx faces charges of murder, indecency with a child, and sexual abuse of a child. He is being held on $600,000 bail.&#13;
</p><p>A Plano, Texas, police official tells PEOPLE that on Sunday, officers were dispatched to the apartment that Amyx shared with his girlfriend, Jennifer Streit-Spears.&#13;
</p><p>When no one came to answer the door, police forced their way inside, where the 43-year-old woman was found unresponsive with multiple lacerations and stab wounds.&#13;
</p><p><!-- insert ssi-->Officers also discovered Amyx laying on the apartment's floor with several knife wounds they contend were self-inflicted.&#13;
</p><p>According to police, Amyx allegedly posted a photo to Streit-Spears's Facebook page, showing the woman's throat slashed open. Detectives confirm he also posted a self-shot image of his blood-splattered face.&#13;
</p><p>The images remained on the site for nearly 36 hours. The caption accompanying the photos read, "Please pray for us and love you all."&#13;

</p><p>"I did ask them to remove it several times," she reportedly said. "They told me I could block Jennifer if I didn't like what she posted and gave me other similar options."&#13;
</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" readability="6.0717948717949"><p lang="en" dir="ltr" xml:lang="en" xml:lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BREAKING?src=hash">#BREAKING</a>: Friends of slain Plano woman, Jennifer Spears, report Facebook pic posted of her murder has been removed. <a href="https://t.co/YGDxWZK1x8">pic.twitter.com/YGDxWZK1x8</a></p>— Justin W. Waldrop (@JustinWWaldrop) <a href="https://twitter.com/JustinWWaldrop/status/737446602323812352">May 31, 2016</a></blockquote>

<br />New York's <em>Daily News</em> reports that Facebook initially declined to take the photos down because they initially believed the victim posted the images as a cry for help. However, it deleted the images after realizing they were seemingly posted by the alleged killer.
<p>"Facebook has long been a place where people share their experiences and raise awareness about important issues," a Facebook spokesperson told the <em>Daily News</em>. "Sometimes, those experiences and issues involve violence and graphic images of public interest or concern."&#13;
</p><p>The news outlet also reports that police learned during this weekend's arrest that Amyx was also wanted in Rockwall County for continued sexual abuse of a child, and in Dallas County for indecent exposure to a child.&#13;
</p><p>Amyx's attorney, Keith Gore, could not be reached for comment. Amyx has not yet appeared in court to enter a plea.</p></div>
