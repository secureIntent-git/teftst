<br><div id=""><p>As it nears its tenth birthday, Twitter is a mess.</p>
<p>The company has struggled to attract new tweeters to join its free-wheeling service, and its stock has spiraled to <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/02/twitter-is-now-worth-less-than-many-of-the-unicorns/" target="_blank">an all-time low this year</a>. Despite Twitter’s efforts, many users continue to face abuse and harassment, and terrorists have disseminated propaganda on the service. In a somewhat self-conscious move, the company rolled out a set of new features this week ahead of its quarterly earnings report , including a new Trust &amp; Safety Council as well as changes to how the Twitter feed works. </p>
<p>In <a href="http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/AMDA-2F526X/1490875248x0x874459/8A4D1A1D-D184-4AFE-9AC1-F880C5EA06F1/Q415_Shareholder_Letter.pdf" target="_blank">that report</a> today, the company revealed that it drew $2.2 billion in revenue last year, up 58 percent. Even so, it lost 2 million users in the fourth quarter, and users are what Wall Street values most as the strongest signal of the company’s health.</p>
<p>The company also outlined its goals for 2016, including fixing broken and confusing parts of the service; continuing to grow its live streaming video offerings with Periscope; helping celebrities and brands gain a greater presence; and investing in making Twitter safer. </p>
<p>But ultimately to fix Twitter, it seems vitally important to understand Twitter. We decided to take a closer look at how Twitter’s top executives use the service to get a sense of how well they seem to grok the platform whose future they’re charged with securing.   </p>
<h3>The Ultimate Twitter Executive Scorecard</h3>
<h3>Jack Dorsey (<a href="https://twitter.com/jack" target="_blank">@jack</a>)</h3>
<p><em>CEO</em><br/><strong>Bio:</strong> “#withMalala!”<br/><strong>Device:</strong> iPhone<br/><strong>Verified:</strong> Duh.<br/><strong>Frequency:</strong> Like a boss (literally) — he tweets dozens of things each day. Since joining in March 2006, he’s tweeted 18,800 times and liked 10,700 tweets.<br/><strong>Style:</strong> @jack tends to retweet-with-a-comment news and updates about Twitter as a company. He’ll also partake in the occasional tweetstorm to respond to our collective complaints. Otherwise, @jack loves a RT—whether it’s loosely related to how great Twitter is (or Periscope or Square, where he’s also CEO), or about something he seems passionate about (go @warriors!). And, yes, he gets a lot of hate.<br/><strong>Grade</strong>: B+ </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" readability="2.7789473684211"><p>“Twitter is life.”—<a href="https://twitter.com/BabersGreen">@BabersGreen</a> <a href="https://t.co/WJHcZrKFfc">https://t.co/WJHcZrKFfc</a> — Jack (@jack) <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/693334818369572864">January 30, 2016</a></p></blockquote>

<h3>Adam Bain (<a href="https://twitter.com/adambain?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank">@adambain</a>)</h3>
<p><em>COO</em><br/><strong>Bio:</strong> “Twitter COO, dad of 2 under 7, insomniac. <a class="link-complex" href="https://twitter.com/warriors/" target="_blank" rel="user" data-user-name="warriors">@<span class="link-complex-target">warriors</span></a> fan. Also: Batik fan (it’s an Indonesia thing, you wouldn’t understand).” <br/><strong> Device: </strong>iPhone &amp; On the Web<br/><strong>Verified:</strong> Nope!<br/><strong> Frequency:</strong> Superuser — like @jack, he tweets a lot, including more than 50 tweets just yesterday. Since joining in March 2008, he’s tweeted 9,428 times.<br/><strong> Style:</strong> @adambain’s tweets feature a whole lot of Twitter, but he likes to be in the mix of Twitter conversations too, especially when it comes to advertising and e-commerce, part of his domains as COO. @adambain will often respond to tweeters (and reporters, like me) even if they didn’t directly @-reply him. He loves a good retweet-with-a-comment.<br/><strong>Grade</strong>: A-</p>

<h3>Anthony Noto (<a href="https://twitter.com/anthonynoto?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank">@anthonynoto</a>)</h3>
<p><em>CFO</em><br/><strong> Bio:</strong> “Twitter CFO”<br/><strong>Device:</strong> iPhone<br/><strong>Verified:</strong> Nope!<br/><strong> Frequency:</strong> Light — lately, he’s tweeted a few times each day but only has 1,119 tweets since joining in April 2009.<br/><strong> Style:</strong> @anthonynoto loves to shares celebrations and good news. He tweets out Moments, things to watch on Periscope, and photos from his life (his pup is cute). He doesn’t respond to a lot of tweeters, but as CFO doesn’t seem to get as many tweets directed towards him as @jack.<br/><strong>Grade</strong>: C-</p>
<h3>Adam Messinger (<a href="https://twitter.com/adam_messinger" target="_blank">@adam_messinger</a>)</h3>
<p><em>CTO</em><br/><strong> Bio: </strong> “CTO <a href="https://twitter.com/twitter">@twitter</a>. Director <a href="https://twitter.com/girlswhocode">@girlswhocode</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/newrelic"><span class="s2">@newrelic</span></a>.”<br/><strong> Device: </strong> iPhone<br/><strong>Verified:</strong> Nope!<br/><strong> Frequency: </strong> Average — he’s tweeted 2,880 times since joining in March 2007, but he’s liked 10,500 tweets. It’s okay, Adam, we lurk on Twitter, too.<br/><strong>Style: </strong> @adam_messinger doesn’t tweet all that much about work, unlike his executive colleagues. He retweets a whole lot, but also responds to things he seems interested in. And, yeah, he uses Twitter to congratulate new colleagues who join Twitter’s revolving flock.<br/><strong>Grade</strong>: B</p>
<h3>Vijaya Gadde (<a href="https://twitter.com/vijaya?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank">@vijaya</a>)</h3>

Comments here are my own…”<br/><strong> Device:</strong> iPhone<br/><strong>Verified:</strong> Nope!<br/><strong> Frequency:</strong> Light — since joining in April 2009, @vijaya has sent out 1,737 tweets and liked 6,909.<br/><strong> Style:</strong> Short and sweet. @vijaya tweets when major sports events are going on (like, well, everyone) and also shares updates about the company. She seems to respond more than she actually tweets—and loves punctuation. People tweet to her about Twitter’s abuse policies and when service is blocked in a country.<br/><strong>Grade</strong>: B </p>
<h3>Leslie Berland (<a href="https://twitter.com/leslieberland?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank">@leslieberland</a>)</h3>
<p><em>CMO</em><br/><strong>Bio:</strong>“Huge @Twitter love, CMO. @americanexpress family member for life. Favorite title: Mama. Never, ever a dull moment. #WWED”<br/><strong> Device:</strong> iPhone &amp; On the Web<br/><strong>Verified:</strong> Nope!<br/><strong> Frequency:</strong> Light — since January 2011, @leslieberland has tweeted 1,895 times. She’s also liked just 309 tweets.<br/><strong> Style:</strong> As a new member of the Twitter team, it’s hard to judge @leslieberland too harshly. In the past few weeks, she’s retweeted-with-a-comment news, retweeted Twitter specific updates and promotions, and shared things that interest her. She actively replies to some of those who tweet at her.<br/><strong>Grade</strong>: B- </p>

He’s only ever replied to a handful of tweets.<br/><strong>Grade</strong>: F</p>

He also seems to love to use emoji. That is, when he tweets.<br/><strong>Grade</strong>: F</p>
