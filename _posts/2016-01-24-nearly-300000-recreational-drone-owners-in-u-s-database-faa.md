The registration applies to drones that weigh between 0.55 pound (250 grams) and 55 pounds (25 kgs).</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Experts have said 700,000 to 1 million unmanned aircraft were expected to be given as gifts in the United States last Christmas alone. People who operated their small unmanned aircraft before Dec. 21 must register by Feb. 19.     </p><span id="midArticle_3"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Owners who registered during the first month had the $5 fee reimbursed. </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>"The registration numbers we’re seeing so far are very encouraging," FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said in a statement.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Federal officials see online registration as a way to address the safety concerns that have arisen as a result of unauthorized drone flights near airports and crowded public venues across the country.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The current system is available only to owners who intend to use drones exclusively for recreational or hobby purposes. The FAA is also working to make the system available for non-model aircraft users including commercial operators by March 21.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Officials say the agency is also working with the private sector to streamline registration including through the use of new smart phone apps that could allow a manufacturer or retailer to register a drone automatically by scanning an identification code on the aircraft.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><span id="midArticle_9"/><p> (Reporting by <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=david.morgan&amp;">David Morgan</a>; Editing by Paul Simao)</p><span id="midArticle_10"/></div>
