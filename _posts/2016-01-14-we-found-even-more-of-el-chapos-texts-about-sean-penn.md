<br><div id=""><p>We were hoping we’d get the sweet-and-lowdown on El Chapo’s texts about Sean Penn, and it looks like our wishes were answered.</p>
<p>What? You haven’t heard?  This week, <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/01/13/el_chapo_s_texts_to_mexican_actress_kate_del_castillo.html" target="_blank">a series of newly revealed text messages</a> gave a behind-the-scenes account of the origins of Sean Penn’s recent (and very hush-hush) <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/el-chapo-speaks-20160109" target="_blank"><em>Rolling Stone </em>interview</a> with Mexican drug baron Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman. The texts—over BlackBerrys between El Chapo, his lawyer, and Mexican actress Kate del Castillo—reveal that not only did the cartel kingpin clearly have the hots for Del Castillo (“You are so beautiful, my friend, in every way”), he also apparently knew very little about the Oscar-winning actor he was about to meet (“I’m looking up Sean Penn online now”).</p>
<p>With help from some <a href="http://www.blastr.com/sites/blastr/files/2015/09/bunsenhoneydew.jpg" target="_blank">encrypted-text experts</a>, WIRED has unearthed even more messages from El Chapo, documenting his deep-dive into Penn’s <em>oeuvre</em>. They are presented here in full, unaltered and unabridged:</p>
<h3>SEPT. 26th, 2015</h3>

<p><strong>Chapo: </strong>i mean I know people who love fincher think, “okay, the game, kind of a fun twilight zone thingee, it’s no seven or social network” but it’s really tight, and sean looks like hes having so much fun</p>
<p><strong>Del Castillo: </strong>right</p>
<p><strong>Chapo: </strong>when you dig into his 90s stuff he was so extreme, like, “okay, this week its dead man walking, then its an episode of friends.” no inbetween.</p>

<p><strong>Chapo: </strong>I mean his imdb is definitely spottier than people remember. And his movies are very frowny. I like dark stuff, but I like to laugh, I like good times, you know? I like many things that I think you like too</p>
<p><strong>Del Castillo: </strong>okay</p>
<p><strong>Chapo: </strong></p>
