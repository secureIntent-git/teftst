				<p>Hell yes. &lt;-- A connected watch for people who aren't primarily concerned with meetings and text messages. Nixon's Mission is an Android Wear smartwatch designed for surfers ? and snow bums ? ; it's waterproof to 100 meters, thanks to an innovative sealed microphone, and has full GPS navigation. Its coolest feature, though, is that it pulls data from <a href="http://www.snocountry.com/" target="_blank">Snocountry</a> and <a href="http://www.surfline.com/home/index.cfm" target="_blank">Surfline</a> to deliver you alerts when the waves or the snow is just right—say, if the swells crest eight feet at Pacifica, or more than a foot of Powder falls at Heavenly. You set the parameters, and, if they're met, the watch will interrupt your day not with another meeting request, but a gentle nudge that it might be time to take a personal day.</p>
