"It's awkward for those of us who have to commute, but I understand they need to do what they need to do for our safety."</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Metrorail has average weekday ridership of about 700,000, and about a third of the region's federal workforce uses it to get to work. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>The region has some of the worst traffic in the United States, and local radio station WTOP predicted the added complication would result in "major mayhem" on the roads.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Normal bus service will be provided on Wednesday, and parking will be free in all Metro-owned lots and garages, the transit agency said.    </p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>San Francisco-based ridesharing company Lyft said it was expecting "very high demand in Washington during the commuting hours and throughout the day," and was offering new customers $20 off their first ride.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Uber [UBER.UL] said it would cap surge pricing in the Washington area at 3.9 times base fares during the shutdown.         </p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>The closure of the 119-mile (230-km) subway system, which has been plagued by equipment breakdowns and fires, will allow safety officials to inspect about the cables for worn-out casings, Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority General Manager Paul Wiedefeld said at a news conference.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>"While the risk to the public is very low, I cannot rule out a potential life safety issue, and this is why we must take this action immediately," he said.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Wiedefeld said the shutdown was prompted by a cable fire early on Monday that caused delays on three of the system's six lines.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><span id="midArticle_15"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>CHERRY BLOSSOM TIME</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>Washington is a major tourist destination throughout the year but attracts more visitors during the spring when cherry trees blossom around major landmarks like the Jefferson Memorial. </p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Many of its hotels, which cater to business people as well as tourists, were sold out as long ago as late last week, making last-minute bookings by commuters difficult. </p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>In Takoma Park, a Maryland suburb about seven miles (11 km) from Washington, residents quickly resorted to a neighborhood listserv to organize carpools. Capital Bikeshare, which allows people to rent bicycles for hours at a time, was offering free  24-hour memberships on Wednesday.  </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Wiedefeld said the closure was the first shutdown of Metrorail, the transit system's rail service, that was not weather related since operations began in the 1970s.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>The shutdown underscores the safety concerns that have plagued Metrorail for decades and have fed a decline in ridership.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Safety supervision of Metrorail was placed under the  Federal Transit Administration in October. It was the first time a U.S. subway system had been put under direct federal oversight for safety lapses.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Since the 1980s, the National Transportation Safety Board has conducted 11 investigations into Metro accidents that have killed a total of 18 people. A blizzard also paralyzed the system for days in January.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Under the vaulted and coffered ceiling of the main downtown Metro station, lighted red signs warned of the imminent shutdown and the mood ranged from sour to resigned.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>"Safety first, but, I mean, it's a mess," said Theresa Spinner, a public relations specialist. She said the fire outage on Monday had stretched a 20-minute trip into a three-hour ordeal.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>"I have a job interview tomorrow morning, and I already have reserved a cab," she said.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Because of the shutdown, absences at public schools will be excused and some charter schools may close, officials said.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><span id="midArticle_12"/><p> (Additional reporting by Andrea Shalal; Writing by Eric Beech and Ian Simpson; Editing by Sandra Maler and Cynthia Osterman)</p><span id="midArticle_13"/></div>
