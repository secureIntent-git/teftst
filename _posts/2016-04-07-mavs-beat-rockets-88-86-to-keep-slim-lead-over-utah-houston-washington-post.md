Barea scored 27 points and the Dallas Mavericks kept a slim cushion over Utah and Houston in the race for the last two Western Conference playoff spots with an 88-86 victory over the Rockets on Wednesday night.</p> <p>The Mavericks’ fifth straight victory — one shy of a season best — put Dallas (40-38) a game ahead of Utah and two up on Houston with four games remaining for all three teams.</p> <p>Dirk Nowitzki was limited to seven points on eight shots, but had a crucial strip of James Harden on a drive in the final seconds with the Mavericks clinging to a one-point lead.</p> <p>Harden scored 26 points and Dwight Howard had 14 points and 16 rebounds for the Rockets, who are in danger of missing the postseason a year after reaching the West finals.</p> <p>The Mavericks held their fifth straight opponent under 90 points after 19 of the previous 21 scored at least 100. It’s part defense and part pace, with the Mavericks slowing things considerably since point guard Deron Williams was sidelined by a left abdominal strain.</p> <p>Barea, who had a game-high eight assists, has been the most important Dallas player since then, scoring at least 20 points in his fourth straight game.</p> <p>And he was at the center of the play pulled Dallas even late, dribbling across the lane and hitting a leaning shot as he was fouled by Patrick Beverley. The free throw made it 85-all.</p> <p>The last field goal for Houston came with 3:20 remaining when Beverley sprinted through the lane and tipped in Howard’s second missed free throw after the 6-foot-11 center was fouled intentionally.</p> <p>Harden missed a pair of 3-pointers late, but had a chance to give the Rockets the lead when he drove on Wesley Matthews with less than 10 seconds remaining. Nowitzki reached around him to knock the ball loose, Dallas won the scramble for the ball and Devin Harris made two free throws for an 88-85 lead with 5 seconds to go.</p> <p>The Rockets went ahead 71-70 going in the fourth when Howard tipped in a lob pass from Jason Terry on an inbounds play with just 0.2 seconds left in the third. And Houston had the biggest lead of the fourth at 80-76 before Dallas’ defense clamped down, outscoring the Rockets 18-15 in the fourth.</p> <p>Houston scored on just three of its last 16 possessions and had six points in the final 9:15 on 2-of-14 shooting.</p> <p>Michael Beasley had 15 points off the bench for the Rockets, who didn’t have anybody else in double figures.</p> <p>Matthews had 16 points for Dallas, including three 3-pointers during a 15-2 run made up entirely of 3s to put Dallas up 10 in the second quarter. Barea had the other two.</p> <p>TIP-INS</p> <p>Rockets: Beverley got three stitches over his left eye after the first of two first-quarter breaks because players were bleeding. He went to the locker room with a towel covering the eye before returning in the second quarter. Mavericks F David Lee had a cut on his right arm late in the quarter. ... Howard had his 37th double-double.</p> <p>Mavericks: Dallas quarterback Tony Romo, a regular on the front row for Mavs games, was joined this time by tight end Jason Witten and three of his offensive linemen — Pro Bowlers Travis Frederick and Zack Martin along with Doug Free. ... Harris scored 10 points.</p> <p>UP NEXT</p> <p>Rockets: Host Phoenix on Thursday.</p> <p>Mavericks: Host Memphis on Friday.</p> <p>Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
