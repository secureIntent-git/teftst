Also abducted from the resort at the time were John Ridsdel, a Canadian mining executive, and Kjartan Sekkingstad, a Norwegian hotel manager. In April, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/26/world/americas/canadian-hostage-john-ridsdel-philippines-abu-sayyaf.html">Mr. Ridsdel was beheaded</a> after ransom demands were not met.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="362" data-total-count="2036">The Canadian and the Philippine governments have policies of not paying ransom, but Philippine officials said last week that family members of the kidnapping victims were negotiating to pay about $6.5 million each for the release of Mr. Hall and Mr. Sekkingstad. Abu Sayyaf had said that they would behead Mr. Hall on Monday afternoon if the ransom was not paid.</p><figure id="abu-sayyaf-explainer" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-small"><figcaption class="interactive-caption"><h2 class="interactive-headline">
