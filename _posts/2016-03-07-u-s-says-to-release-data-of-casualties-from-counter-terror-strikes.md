<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocation">WASHINGTON</span> The United States said on Monday that in the coming weeks it will publicly release an assessment of combatant and non-combatant casualties from U.S. counter-terrorism strikes in areas outside active war zones since 2009.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The decision, which follows criticism by human rights groups and others that drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia and Libya have caused civilian casualties, was taken in the interest of transparency, according to Lisa Monaco, President Barack Obama's homeland security adviser.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The data would be released annually in future, she said.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"We know that not only is greater transparency the right thing to do, it is the best way to maintain the legitimacy of our counter-terrorism effort and the broad support of our allies," Monaco told the Council on Foreign Relations.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Monaco declined to provide details of the assessment, but said it would reflect the "latest intelligence from all sources" as well as input from human rights groups who monitor U.S. drone strikes and other U.S. counter-terrorism operations.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Rights groups have accused the Obama administration of not being forthcoming about the precise guidelines that govern drone strikes and dispute government claims that there is no evidence that they have produced "collateral damage," a euphemism for civilian casualties.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>There have also been questions raised about precisely who the administration has hit.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>In 2013, McClatchy newspapers reported that contrary to assurances that U.S. drone strikes targeted only known leaders of al Qaeda and allied groups, classified documents showed that the Obama administration had killed hundreds of suspected lower-level militants in scores of attacks in Pakistan's tribal areas.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The assessment will cover "all counter-terrorism actions outside the area of active hostilities across the board," Monaco said in response to a question.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>The report, Monaco said, stemmed from a pledge to provide greater transparency into U.S. counter-terrorism operations that Obama made in 2013.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>White House spokesman Josh Earnest the data would include specific numbers as part of efforts to be more open about such security programs, when possible.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>"There's obviously limitations on that, but there is more that we can do," he told reporters at a daily news briefing.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Perhaps most controversial in the United States are 2011 drone strikes authorized by Obama that killed four American civilians, including Anwar al Awlaki, an Islamic scholar and a leader of al Qaeda's Yemeni affiliate, who used the Internet to recruit new members.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><span id="midArticle_14"/><p> (Reporting by David Brunnstrom, Jonathan Landay and Susan Heavey; Editing by Chris Reese and Alan Crosby)</p><span id="midArticle_15"/></div>
