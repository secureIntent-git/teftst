        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"Like the criminal matter, Mr. Paxton vehemently denies the allegations in the civil lawsuit and looks forward to not only all of the facts coming out, but also to establishing his innocence in both the civil and criminal matters," said William Mateja, Paxton's Dallas-based lawyer.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Servergy, which has cut ties with Mapp, agreed to pay a $200,000 penalty to settle the SEC’s charges without admitting or denying the agency's charges.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The SEC's case relates to investor communications made while Servergy was under Mapp's leadership, the company said.
