(Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post)</span> </div> <p>NEW YORK-- Hillary Clinton will announce a proposal for $10 billion in funds for manufacturing partnerships while campaigning in Syracuse on Friday.</p> <p>The proposal, which is an investment in "Make it in America Partnerships," is aimed at encouraging manufacturers both large and small to locate manufacturing jobs in the United States.</p> <p>Upstate New York, with its mix of manufacturing and rural towns, will serve as the setting for both the announcement and a bulk of Clinton's campaigning in the state in the coming weeks, the campaign said.</p> <p>According to Clinton's senior policy adviser Jake Sullivan, the campaign believes that Clinton's record of encouraging the return of manufacturing in parts of the state will be a key part of her argument not only to New Yorkers but to voters at large.</p> <p>"We absolutely believe that her work as senator in Upstate New York will serve as a blueprint for what she will do as president," Sullivan said in a call with reporters previewing the announcement.</p> <p>Clinton will host a roundtable focused on manufacturing in Syracuse on Friday.</p> <p>Clinton's travels across the state will feature testimonials from New Yorkers who have worked with her in the past on economic issues, according to Sullivan.</p> <p>"The campaign will really be highlighting how Hillary made a difference -- a real difference in people's live," Sullivan added. "She'll be greeted by familiar faces who know what she did to help them.</p> <p>"Unlike her opponent, she can show how she can actually get things done as president," he added, hitting Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.</p> <p channel="wp.com" class="interstitial-link"> <i> [<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/for-clinton-a-double-barreled-fight-against-trump-and-sanders-in-everybodys-home-state-ny/2016/03/31/1169a47a-f6ba-11e5-a3ce-f06b5ba21f33_story.html">For Clinton, a double-barreled fight against Trump and Sanders in New York</a>] </i> </p> <p>According to Sullivan, the proposal will be paid for though a "clawback" tax Clinton proposed earlier on corporations leaving the United States and moving jobs overseas.</p> <p>While most of the state's population density is downstate -- particularly in New York City and the surrounding areas, Clinton's focus in upstate reflects a desire to shore up support in a part of the state that may be a ripe target for Sanders.</p> <p>Sanders has targeted voters in states like Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin with a message that is critical of free-trade policies that are blamed for the loss of U.S. jobs to international competitors.</p> <p>Upstate New York's demographics and economics are similar to those states, where the Sanders campaign believed they had a shot of winning -- and in the case of Michigan, did win. And the region also boasts a fair number of college and university students, who overwhelmingly support Sanders.</p> <p>New York will hold its primary on April 19 and both Sanders and Clinton say that the result will be pivotal in the race for the Democratic nomination.</p></article> <div class="post-body-sig-line" readability="22.875862068966"><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/people/abby-phillip"><img src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/1459506376_435_Clinton-launches-big-Upstate-New-York-push-with-10-billion-manufacturing-proposal-Washington-Post.jpg" data-threshold="480" class="post-body-headshot-left "/></a><div class="post-body-bio has-photo" readability="23.613793103448">Abby Phillip is a national political reporter for the Washington Post.
