<br><div id="start-of-content"><article class="content link-underline relative body-copy" data-js="content" itemprop="articleBody" readability="58.873728813559"><p>The Fujifilm X-T1 is one of the best mirrorless cameras in recent memory. Finally, after two and a half years, it’s getting a sequel. The new X-T2 won’t be in stores until September, but it’ll shoot higher-resolution stills and video, offer a beefed-up autofocus system, and share the same excellent sensor as the <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/03/review-fujifilm-x-pro2/">Fujifilm X-Pro2</a>.</p>
<p data-js="fader" class="pullquote carve fader">
	Fujifilm’s sensor uses a pixel pattern designed to capture images that look more like they were shot with film.	<span class="attribution"/>
</p>
<br/>The X-T2’s X-Trans III APS-C sensor ramps up the resolution to 24 megapixels, up from 16 megapixels in its predecessor. Its key trait remains unchanged: Unlike the Bayer pattern color filters used in the majority of sensors, Fujifilm’s X-Trans chip has a different pixel pattern designed to capture images that look more like they were shot with film. This new model also has the film-simulation modes found in the X-Pro2, so there are multiple options for making your shots appear more film-like.
<p>That sensor should also provide better wall-to-wall AF coverage than the first-generation camera. The X-T2’s hybrid phase/contrast-detection autofocus system has 325 points of focus, more than six times the number of focus points in the previous model. And while video wasn’t the X-T1’s strong suit, that could change with this model. It shoots 4K video at 30fps and 24fps, and you can use those film-simulation effects while recording.</p>
<p>Some of the best features of the X-T1 remain unchanged here. The ISO range is still 100 to 51,200. It still shoots RAW and has handy focus-peaking features. There’s still a great 2.3-million-dot OLED viewfinder and a tilting 3-inch LCD screen, which is still not a touchscreen. It’s still weather-sealed, and it’s still quick on the trigger. According to Fujifilm, the X-T2 has an autofocus speed of 0.06 seconds, a boot-up time of 0.3 seconds, and a continuous-shooting speed of 8fps out of the box. There’s a separately sold vertical booster grip—one that houses two extra batteries—that increases that burst mode to 11fps.</p>
<p>It also remains expensive for an APS-C-sensored camera. The Fujifilm X-T2 will go for $1,600 for the body only when it ships in September. Add $300 for the bundle with an 18-55mm lens (27-84mm with the 1.5X crop factor).</p>
