      --> <p>MANILA—A mayor whose recipe for national revival involves a harsh crackdown on criminality was poised to complete an extraordinary political upset in <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/briefly/2016/05/08/5-things-things-about-the-philippine-election/" class="icon none">Philippine presidential elections</a> and become the country’s next leader.</p> <p>With 60% of ballots counted as of late Monday, Rodrigo Duterte had 39% of the vote, 17 points ahead of his nearest challenger.</p> <p>When Mr. Duterte entered the presidential race last year he was generally viewed as a wild-card candidate who would at best inject some color into the contest.</p> <p>During the campaign, he pledged to kill criminals and to end crime and corruption within six months, punctuating his speeches with obscene asides about rape and masculinity. As recently as early April, Mr. Duterte’s voter support was roughly level with that of his three main rivals.</p> <p>But as polls closed on Monday, he was on course to record a victory that owed as much to the strategic missteps of his rivals as to his appeal as a crime fighter.</p> <p>As a longstanding city mayor, Mr. Duterte has little experience of foreign policy and the implications of his likely victory for relations between Manila and Washington and other allies are unclear.</p> <!--
      --> 
<!--
      --> <p>In speech late Monday, Mr. Duterte dismissed the “black propaganda” of the election campaign and said he wanted to “reach a hand to my opponents.” He hadn’t claimed victory, saying in a television interview that he would “wait until the last vote is counted.”</p> <p>Earlier, a huge crowd mobbed the 71-year-old as he voted in his southern city of Davao, thrilling supporters with the raised-fist salute that has become his trademark. Some 300,000 people had flocked to his final campaign rally in Manila on Saturday.</p> <p>Millions of Filipinos across the archipelago cast their ballots on Monday. Glitches with automatic vote-counting machines led to voting hours being extended beyond the 5 p.m. deadline in some districts, delaying preliminary results. Election authorities estimate that 80% of the votes will have been counted by Tuesday morning.</p> <!--

      --> <p> Candidates need just a plurality of votes, not an outright majority, to win in the Philippines’ election system.</p> <!--

      --> <p>Outgoing President Benigno Aquino III, who has overseen an economic revival since taking office in 2010, warned at a rally on Saturday that the country would be flirting with dictatorship if it backed Mr. Duterte, and urged voters to “remember how Hitler came to power.”</p> <p>But by then, the harsh justice promised by Mr. Duterte was already proving a bigger hit with voters than Mr. Aquino’s preferred successor, economist and technocrat Manuel Roxas II.</p> <p>"I’m voting for Duterte—we need discipline,” said Victoria Monserat, an accountant and mother of three, as she voted in Manila on Monday, backing the mayor’s pledge to declare a “bloody war” on criminals.</p> <p>In Davao, where he has been mayor since the 1980s, Mr. Duterte is widely credited with restoring law and order by allowing vigilantes to kill over 1,000 suspected street criminals. He now promises to take the same violent approach nationwide. Tens of thousands of people will die during this purge, he has said.</p> <p>“Forget the laws on human rights,” he told supporters over the weekend.</p> <!--

      --> <p>While many Filipinos fear his promised crackdown, Aurora Guanzon, a Manila nurse, said Davao’s cleanliness and orderliness had made a strong impression on her during several trips there. “That is why I voted for Duterte,” she said. “I don’t think he can solve the troubles of this country overnight, but gradually he could do it. He has done it in Davao City.”</p> <p>The seeds of Mr. Duterte’s emergence as presidential front-runner appear to have been sown in July, when Mr. Aquino had dinner at the presidential palace with two of his most trusted political allies, Mr. Roxas and Sen. Grace Poe. His purpose was to convince the two to contest the presidential election together on a platform of continuity, sustaining his administration’s social and economic programs. But Ms. Poe, who was riding high in the polls, declined to be the running mate of Mr. Roxas, an awkward campaigner who lagged behind Ms. Poe in voter surveys.</p> <p>With the two Aquino allies now rivals, they began competing for many of the same votes, praising Mr. Aquino on the stump and promising to build on his reforms. Mr. Aquino formally endorsed Mr. Roxas, but there was intense media speculation that he was secretly supporting Ms. Poe’s bid. Both Mr. Aquino and Ms. Poe denied having an unofficial alliance.</p> <p>Mr. Duterte offered a different agenda. A native of the southern island of Mindanao, Mr. Duterte is popular in the central and southern Philippines, where many people regard Manila as the home of a remote political elite.</p> <p>However, Mr. Duterte’s strong ratings even in the capital demonstrated that his brazen anticrime message had nationwide appeal.</p> <!--
      --> 
<!--
      --> <p>Throughout the campaign, Mr. Duterte was prone to gaffes. He joked about an Australian woman who had been raped and murdered in Davao, and peppered his speeches with sexist remarks. He threatened to sever ties with allies Australia and the U.S. if they criticized him, and referred to Pope Francis as a “son of a bitch” in a country where 80% of people are Roman Catholics.</p> <p>But with every sound bite, Mr. Duterte’s ratings jumped. His tough-talking approach contrasted with the stiff political correctness of his rivals and made him seem more like an anti-establishment figure with whom an ordinary voter could identify. His professed reluctance to take on the president’s responsibilities also contrasted with the naked ambition of most other career politicians, as did the apparent modesty of his lifestyle.</p> <p>Though many Filipinos credit Mr. Aquino with reducing corruption and establishing strong economic foundations for the fast-growing country, there is also a widespread perception that progress has been too patchy, and that many poor families have been left behind.</p> <p>“Our communication hasn’t been great,” said Joel Rocamora, Mr. Aquino’s anti-poverty secretary. “People don’t know what the government has done.”</p> <p>There is also widespread exhaustion with the political elite represented by Mr. Roxas and by Mr. Aquino, both scions of former presidents, while the rough-edged city mayor’s strident rhetoric has struck a chord with jaded voters.</p> <p>On Friday, Mr. Roxas appeared on TV to urge Ms. Poe to talk to him about merging their two campaigns, but she was unimpressed. “What’s there to talk about?” she asked.</p> <p class="articleTagLine">—Cris Larano contributed to this article.</p> <p> <strong>Write to </strong>Trefor Moss at <a href="mailto:Trefor.Moss@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">Trefor.Moss@wsj.com</a> </p>
