					<p>In an era where cars <a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/autonomous-vehicles">can drive themselves</a>, shred tires with <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/11/dodge-hellcat-burnout-gifs/">obscene levels of power</a>, and go hundreds of miles on a charge, it’s easy to overlook a car like the Beetle Dune. That’s too bad. I drove 700 miles around Northern California in one, barreling down interstates, carving through mountains, and taking in views of the coast and can say this unassuming drop-top is everything you want in a car. It’s handsome, affordable, efficient, practical, and fun.</p>

				<p>I had no trouble getting three adults and their backpacks into the car for a long weekend of camping. Granted, we had to buckle one pack into the rear seat, but the other two Tetris’ed into the 15.4-cubic foot trunk. With the roof up, it’s not exactly spacious (especially for the passenger in back), but the visibility’s good enough to stave off any claustrophobia. Not bad for a car that can also park between two San Francisco driveways.</p>
