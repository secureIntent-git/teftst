        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Foreign spy agencies in the future also might be able to take advantage of the proliferation and tangle of devices to conduct surveillance, track locations, target informants for potential recruitment, or gain access to networks or user credentials.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The U.S. government and companies like Sony Pictures and Target have been the victim of high-profile hacks that were largely met with legislative inaction and administrative uncertainty on how best to address evolving cyber threats.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Terrorism is the other most imminent threat facing the United States in the coming year, Clapper told the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees in prepared testimony.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Islamic State remains the "pre-eminent terrorist threat" in the world because of the territory it controls in Iraq and Syria, Clapper said.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Al Qaeda affiliates, most notably the one in Yemen known as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, also have proven resilient and are "positioned to make gains in 2016" despite pressure from Western counter-terrorism operations that have degraded the network's core operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan, Clapper said.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>However, while the United States "will almost certainly remain at least a rhetorically important enemy" for many foreign militant groups, "homegrown violent extremists ... will probably continue to pose the most significant Sunni terrorist threat to the U.S. homeland in 2016," he said. </p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>"The perceived success" of attacks by such extremists in Europe and San Bernardino, California, "might motivate others to replicate opportunistic attacks with little or no warning, diminishing our ability to detect terrorist operational planning and readiness," Clapper said.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>A married couple inspired by Islamist militants shot and killed 14 people in San Bernardino in December.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><span id="midArticle_14"/><p> (Writing by <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=doina.chiacu&amp;">Doina Chiacu</a>; Editing by <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=mohammad.zargham&amp;">Mohammad Zargham</a> and <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=alistairbell&amp;">Alistair Bell</a>)</p><span id="midArticle_15"/></div>
