<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocation">NEW YORK</span> A U.S. appeals court on Monday restored the four-game "Deflategate" suspension of New England Patriots star quarterback Tom Brady over allegations footballs he used were under inflated before an NFL playoff game in 2015.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York reversed a federal judge's ruling from September that had overturned the suspension, holing that National Football League Commissioner Roger Goodell properly exercised his discretion.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>"Our review of the record yields the firm conclusion that the Commissioner properly exercised his broad discretion to resolve an intramural controversy between the League and a player," Circuit Judge Barrington Parker wrote for the majority.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The ruling came in a 2-1 vote by the three-judge panel, and followed arguments last month where a lawyer for the players' union faced tough questioning that signaled the likely reversal of U.S. District Judge Richard Berman's ruling.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Representatives for the NFL, the Patriots and the union, the National Football League Players Association, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Brady, 38, had been suspended in May 2015, four months after under-inflated footballs were used in the Patriots' 45-7 victory over Indianapolis in January 2015's AFC championship game.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>That win took the Patriots to the Super Bowl, where they defeated the defending champion Seattle Seahawks, giving Brady his fourth championship title.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The NFL suspended the league's two-times most valuable player after Ted Wells, a lawyer hired by the NFL to investigate the incident, said Brady was "generally aware" that two Patriots employees had conspired to deflate the balls, which could make them easier to grip.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Goodell upheld the suspension on July 28, prompting the legal challenge on Brady's behalf. Brady has denied knowing about any plan to deflate footballs.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Berman in Manhattan overturned Goodell's decision last Sept. 3. He said Brady "had no notice that his discipline would be the equivalent of the discipline imposed upon a player who used performance enhancing drugs."</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Berman's decision allowed Brady to play the full 2015 NFL season. The Patriots made the playoffs but did not reach the Super Bowl.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><span id="midArticle_12"/><p> (Reporting by Nate Raymond and Joseph Ax in New York; Editing by Frances Kerry and Alan Crosby)</p><span id="midArticle_13"/></div>
