<br><p>"Well, I don't want to say it's a threat. But it is a threat," he told NBC's Chuck Todd on "Meet the Press" in an interview aired Sunday. </p><p>He added "it's fine" if his own personal history -- including his divorces -- is scrutinized during the presidential race. </p><p>The Republican front-runner has blasted the former president, calling him "an abuser" and highlighting allegations from <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/01/07/politics/bill-clinton-history-2016-election/index.html">Juanita Broaddrick saying Clinton had raped her</a>, as Trump pushes back on the campaign trail against Democratic rival Hillary Clinton casting him as sexist. </p><p>Trump repeated his criticism, saying Hillary Clinton is "married to an abuser. A woman claimed rape, and all sorts of things. I mean, horrible things." </p><div readability="67"><p class="zn-body__paragraph">And he said he doesn't mind attention on his own history -- including two divorces. </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">"You know what? I wasn't the President of the United States. And I wasn't dealing in the Oval Office, all right? A big difference. I wasn't the president," Trump said. "And my first wife thinks I'm great. And my second wife ... I have a great marriage. I mean, I have a great marriage. So I mean, it's fine." </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Trump said even if he doesn't mind the scrutiny, the Clintons have avoided confrontation with him, taking pains to avoid responding. </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">"I'm not saying don't bring anything up with me," Trump said. "But when she says that, I had to bring it up. And by the way, they've become very unresponsive since then."</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Hillary Clinton was asked about Trump's criticism on CBS' "Face the Nation" Sunday. </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">"If he wants to engage in personal attacks from the past, that's his prerogative. You know -- so be it," Clinton said. "I'm going to draw distinctions between where I stand and where he stands when it comes to equal pay for women, raising the minimum wage ... protecting a woman's right to make the most personal health care decisions." </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Pressed further, Clinton said of her husband's sex allegations: "It's been fair game going back to the Republicans for some years. They can do it again if they want to ... Didn't work before. It won't work again."</p></div>
