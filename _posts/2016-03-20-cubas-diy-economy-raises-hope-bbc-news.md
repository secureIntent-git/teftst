                    Many see Cuba as on the brink of economic changes that will reshape the island

And a new emerging class of Cubans is ready to capitalise. </p><p>The last time a US president visited the island, he declared Cuba to be "free and prosperous". </p><p>Without the use of Air Force One, Calvin Coolidge sailed overnight from Florida, following a journey by steam train from Washington that lasted 32 hours and had no air conditioning. </p><p>As President Barack Obama follows in Coolidge's footsteps 88 years later, in considerably superior comfort, he won't be able to make the same bold statement but he hopes his visit can bring that day forward.</p><p>His arrival comes at a time when the country could be on the brink of changes that reshape the lives of the 11m islanders and heal one of the world's most fractious relationships.</p><p>Such is the excitement among Cubans, especially the youth, he could not have picked a more apt day to arrive than Palm Sunday.</p><p>There will not be people waving palms lining the streets but there will be freshly paved tarmac for the president's motorcade, and the monuments on his route have been given a fresh clean and polish. </p><p>If only the two nations' differences could be patched up as easily.</p><figure class="media-landscape has-caption full-width"><span class="image-and-copyright-container">

Since becoming president in 2008, Raul Castro has expanded the list of permitted businesses to more than 200 and made getting a licence easier. </p><p>Economists estimate between 20-30% of the workforce is now privately employed. In a country where Fidel Castro stood on the steps of Havana University in 1968 and pledged to expel commercial enterprise, that's quite a transformation.</p><hr class="story-body__line"/><h2 class="story-body__crosshead">10 (unlikely) professions now legal in Cuba</h2><figure class="media-landscape has-caption full-width"><span class="image-and-copyright-container">

But it also widens the gap between the haves and have-nots.</p><p>Which group you fall into usually depends on what connections you have to American dollars, relatives abroad or foreign tourists.</p><p>The average Cuban wage is $20 a month, and ever since the fall of the Soviet Union deprived it of an influx of cash, the Cuban economy has been lagging behind the rest of Latin America. </p><figure class="media-landscape no-caption full-width"><span class="image-and-copyright-container">

Like its nearly-identical twin, it is under repair but Raul Castro has called it a "jewel" that will house the parliament again in the coming months.</p><p>A few feet from its manicured lawns, Angel Valencia, 69, is shining shoes. Born into a family of nine children living in one room nearby, he gets a state pension of the equivalent of $8 a month - not enough to buy a round of beers at a nearby cafe.</p><figure class="media-landscape has-caption full-width"><span class="image-and-copyright-container">

While proud to say he fought in the revolution, he has nothing but praise for President Obama. </p><p>"Obama is the first president in 55 years who wanted to help Cuba," he says, with a sparkle in his eyes. "He has many qualities I like. And the relationship will finally heal."</p><p>Not all Cubans are so positive about the visit. About 20 minutes away from the old city, rubbish and rubble lie in piles in a neighbourhood that Cubans call a solar, made up of favela-style, mazy alleys and poor housing.</p><p>Following a path down an alleyway lined with laundry, there's an opening on the left into a two-room home inhabited by three generations of one family.</p><p>The breadwinner Miguel, who did not want to give his real name, says he works two jobs. His income goes entirely on food for him, his three-year-old son and his mother, but it still leaves them hungry.</p><p>Mr Obama's visit means nothing to him, he says. "When the changes come, I won't be alive."</p><figure class="media-landscape has-caption full-width"><span class="image-and-copyright-container">
