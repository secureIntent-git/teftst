<br><div id="start-of-content"><article class="content link-underline relative body-copy" data-js="content" itemprop="articleBody" readability="47.986046511628"><p>First things first: Happy Star Wars Day, everyone! May the Force be with you. If you happen to weirdly live in a household that doesn’t celebrate Star Wars <em>every</em> day, today—May the Fourth—is the day when we call all unabashedly talk about the galaxy far, far away. As such, we’re celebrating Star Wars on this week’s <em>Monitor</em> by sharing a few of our favorite memories of time spent with the franchise. (<em>Memories, light the corners of our minds…</em>)</p>



<p>But it’s not all nostalgia this week on the WIRED Culture podcast. We’ve also got a <em>lot</em> to look forward to. Like, for example, <em>Captain America: Civil War</em>, which hits theaters this weekend. We also have the better part of a season of <em>Game of Thrones</em> ahead of us, not to mention plenty of other TV and even a few forthcoming albums. (Seriously, when will Chance the Rapper release <em>Chance 3</em>?! We’re dying over here.)</p>
<p>So yeah, there’s a lot on our minds on this week’s podcast. We’ve got editors and writers <a href="http://www.wired.com/author/peterrubin/" target="_blank">Peter Rubin</a>, <a href="http://www.wired.com/author/awatercutter/" target="_blank">Angela Watercutter</a>, and <a href="http://www.wired.com/author/kevin-mcfarland/" target="_blank">K.M. McFarland</a> in the booth and we’re ready to unload about <em>Game of Thrones</em> deaths and Ewok life.</p>
<p>A few helpful links for things we talk about in the podcast:</p>
