On March 10, in a blog post that has since been deleted, Mr. Sarkar called Dr. Klug, 39, “a sick person.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="303" data-total-count="4154">“I was this guy’s Ph.D. student,” he wrote. “We had personal differences. He cleverly stole all my code and gave it another student. He made me really sick.” Chief Beck said at a news conference that investigators think the claim was unfounded and that Mr. Sarkar had “some mental issues.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="310" data-total-count="4464">On Wednesday, Mr. Sarkar walked into the Engineering IV building, entered the fourth-floor office of <a href="http://www.mae.ucla.edu/william-klug/">Dr. Klug</a>, and opened fire. The professor, married and the father of two small children, was considered a star in computational biomechanics, a field that applies engineering principles to biology and medicine.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="206" data-total-count="4670">Dr. Klug was a devoted youth baseball coach.

Professors had known of Mr. Sarkar’s grudge against some faculty members, he added, but they did not think he posed a threat. Court records in Minnesota indicate that Mr. Sarkar’s only run-ins with the law were minor traffic and parking tickets.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

David Myers, a former chairman of the history department who has offered “active shooter” training, said that when he met with students who seem enraged or unstable, he found himself watching their hands, ever more cognizant of the possibility that they might be armed.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="279" data-total-count="6295">“I sort of lived in fear of this day coming to my own campus,” Dr. Myers said. “And it did. It did.” Ideally, a university “is a place of free movement of ideas and people,” he said. “When that is constrained in the way it was yesterday, something is killed off.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="348" data-total-count="6643">Stephen Aron, who succeeded Mr. Myers as chairman of the history department, said he had become quicker to refer troubled students to counselors rather than trying to discuss their problems. Digital communication makes it harder to tell how students really are, he added, because “it’s harder to parse out tone in an email than face-to-face.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="262" data-total-count="6905">“People are feeling a bit discombobulated today,” he said. “I’m hearing that mostly from my staff. They’re the ones there every day, so in some sense they’re most vulnerable in those situations. It’s not surprising they feel particularly scared.”</p><a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#whats-next">Continue reading the main story</a>
