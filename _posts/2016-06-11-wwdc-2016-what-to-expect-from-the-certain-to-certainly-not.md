					<p>Every year, Apple huddles its developers together to spin tales of software improvements to come. And while some of the announcements coming on Monday are pretty much a lock—hello, Siri!—other rumors seem a lot less likely. Here’s what to expect, from the certain to the almost certainly not.</p>

						<h3>Siri Plays Nice With Third-Party Apps</h3>
			
			<div class=" listicle-captions hide-med hide-mob" readability="12.467213114754">
				<p>Siri was early to the voice assistant party, but you wouldn’t know it given <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/06/hey-siri-time-put-shut/">its many limitations</a>. This year’s biggest WWDC focus looks to be opening up Siri to third-party developers, so that it can integrate with their apps, instead of just Apple software and a handful of selected partners. If Apple wants to keep up with Google and Amazon—whose Alexa assistant has over a thousand integrations since it launched in late 2014—it’s going to need a little help from its friends.</p>
