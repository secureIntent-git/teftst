Islamic State fighters often targeted younger Yazidi children as a means of punishing their mothers, the report said. It cited an account of a fighter who killed several children after their mother’s effort to escape failed: The mother was then beaten and raped because she cried over their deaths.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="168" data-total-count="5613">“No other religious group present in ISIS-controlled areas of Syria and Iraq has been subjected to the destruction that the Yazidis have suffered,” the report said.</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#whats-next">Continue reading the main story</a>
