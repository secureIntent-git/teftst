<br><div id=""><p>The fact that American butts <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/181271/obesity-rate-inches-2014.aspx">are getting bigger</a> would be less of a problem if the cheap seats on airliners weren’t simultaneously getting smaller. Alas, neither trend shows any sign of abating. The obesity epidemic is as bad as ever, and airlines remains as desperate as ever to cram as many customers as possible into their planes.</p>
<p>If things are going to get any better, airlines need solutions more creative than saying, “<a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/04/oh-good-airbus-wants-pack-11-passengers-one-row/" target="_blank">Let’s just jam more people in there</a>.” Airbus has an idea that just may fit the bill: Replacing individual seats with benches that flight crews can reconfigure on the fly to suit passengers of different shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>This month, the European aerospace giant <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/airbus-patent-bench-seat-revolutionize-airline-ticket-sales-2016-2">received a US patent</a> for a “reconfigurable passenger bench seat,” which is exactly what it sounds like. Instead of three seats side-by-side, Airbus would provide a bench of the same overall width. It features seat belts that can be attached at various points, easily accommodating two, three, or four passengers.</p>
<p>The idea is that providing more choices in configuration will allow airlines to optimize seating. “Optimum utilization of the space available in a passenger cabin is of major economic importance,” the patent argues. The cabin layout “should be as flexibly, rapidly, was easily reconfigurable as possible.”</p>
<p>Of course, Airbus sees this as a way of maximizing comfort, by allowing those of larger stature to have a little more room, and convenience, by allowing families with small children to sit in the same row. The cynical among you may see this as a way of cramming four adults into space previously occupied by three, or generating new “services” that justify charging passengers more money. Whatever side of that debate you come down on, the point may well be moot.</p>
<p>“It’s not gonna happen,” says Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst with the Teal Group. Aviation interiors simply don’t change this radically, certainly not with any speed. The investment is enormous, in part because the rules that govern aircraft are so strict. Seats in commercial aircraft must be able to withstand a forward force of 16Gs without breaking—the test that measures that decelerates a dummy-loaded row of seats from 44 feet per second to a dead stop in under a tenth of a second. They must be flame retardant, and must adhere to a mandate that an airplane can be fully evacuated within 90 seconds. The seats must protect occupants from “debilitating leg and spine injuries” in the event of a crash, and must hold their shape so they don’t trap passengers. There’s no obvious reason to think a bench seat would be less capable of meeting those standards, but getting anything to pass all the required tests is a Herculean undertaking measured in years, not months.</p>
<p>Still, Aboulafia says, it’s not a bad idea to stack up intellectual property (Airbus holds many patents for everything from A to B), and who knows where this could be used. Even the patent application says it could also be “for use in other means of transport, such as buses or trains.” Airbus stacks up all kinds of patents, for everything from vacuum toilets with urinal functions, <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/11/airbus-patents-detachable-cabins-to-cut-plane-boarding-times/">to detachable cabins</a>, to a <a href="http://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?docid=20150274298&amp;SectionNum=2&amp;IDKey=04108B8962F7&amp;HomeUrl=http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2%2526Sect2=HITOFF%2526p=1%2526u=%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsearch-bool.html%2526r=12%2526f=G%2526l=50%2526co1=AND%2526d=PG01%2526s1=airbus%2526OS=airbus%2526RS=airbus">nightmarish bunk bed-inspired setup</a>.</p>
<p>So let’s humor Airbus for a moment. One wide bench means no more alarming your neighbor as you blindly hunt for the phone you dropped into the space between your seats. The seat back wouldn’t recline, which is probably better than subjecting the whole plane to arguments between four strangers—or family members—over their preferred position. The bench would feature armrests for each potential configuration, and recesses to store those that aren’t being used so they aren’t jabbing you in the back. A potential downside: The fact that you’re sharing a seating surface may take away the little isolation you have from your fellow passengers standing up and sitting down throughout the flight.</p>
<p>The two-seat setup would be best for passengers who require increased space, such as those of larger stature or passengers with restricted mobility. And offering more space means, naturally, that airlines can charge more for the extra comfort. Airbus also suggests using this setup for business class, though <em>Enjoy a greater percentage of this bench!</em> doesn’t seem like the best way to attract passengers with disposable income.</p>
<p>The three-person configuration would duplicate the current configuration widely used in economy class. The four-passenger setup could be used by families with small children, Airbus says, since there’s room for two adults and two young kids. (What’s confusing is that none of the patent drawings show children, though one features two adult ventriloquist traveling with their dummies. Which makes sense, really—you don’t want to shove them into the overhead bin, since they’re expensive, nor do you want to burn all your extra money buying full seats for each of them.)</p>
<p>So no, you won’t be flying on a bench anytime soon. But in the <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/09/airbus-virtual-reality-helmets/" target="_blank">growing pantheon of troubling aerospace patents</a>, it’s not the most heinous idea. That award still goes to Zodiac Seats France, whose <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hey-look-nightmarish-idea-plane-seating-ever/" target="_blank">“Economy Class Cabin Hexagon”</a> puts your neighbors right in your face.</p>
