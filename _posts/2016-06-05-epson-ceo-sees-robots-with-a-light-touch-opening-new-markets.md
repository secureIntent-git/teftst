<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="10"><p><span class="articleLocation">DUESSELDORF, Germany</span> Technology developed by Epson (<span id="symbol_6724.T_0">6724.T</span>) that enables robots to perform precise tasks, such as putting a key into a keyhole and turning it with just the right amount of force, is set to open up new markets for the printers, projectors and robotics group, its president told Reuters in an interview.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The Japanese group this week unveiled a new piezo force sensor based on its proprietary inkjet printing technology that has made it a global household name, which it hopes will give it an edge as it seeks to quintuple its robotics sales over the next decade.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The Micro Piezo sensor, which attaches to a robot head,  allows the robot to feel its way into a space with an accuracy of 5 microns or 5 thousandths of a millimeter, a roughly tenfold improvement on currently available force sensors, Epson says.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"It changes the way robots can be used," President and Chief Executive Minoru Usui told Reuters, speaking through a translator. "We think the market potential for the force sensor is enormous."</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Usui said the new sensor could enable Epson to address new markets such as food production, medical equipment and pharmaceuticals, with the automation of tasks such as putting syringes together or packaging medicines.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>"To perform complex tasks like this with robots, it has needed really complex software, which has made it impossible for many people," he said. "This makes the software a lot simpler, which makes it easier to actually introduce the robots."</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The company said by adopting the sensor technology tasks such as placing a capacitor or resistor in an integrated circuit with dozens of tiny holes could be done with less expensive precision tools or software than currently required because the robot can find its own way to locating where the component needs to go.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>It could also make for easier automation of tasks like polishing, where a light touch is needed.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>The new sensor has a list price of 6,500 euros ($7,200), and is compatible across Epson's robot range, increasing the total price of an industrial robot by around a quarter to a third.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>The potential market is seen largely in countries with low levels of industrial automation like China, India and Brazil, where precision equipment and processes are not already widely in place, said Epson's German factory automation sales manager Dirk Folkens.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>"They are more or less just starting automation," he said. "German manufacturing is very sophisticated."</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>China, the world's biggest industrial robotics market, still has only 36 robots per 100,000 employees, about half the global average. But it is hungry to automate more, and home appliances maker Midea (<span id="symbol_000333.SZ_1">000333.SZ</span>) is currently trying to buy German robotics specialist Kuka (<span id="symbol_KU2G.DE_2">KU2G.DE</span>) for 4.5 billion euros. </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Epson itself has just begun using force-sensing robots in its own factories to assemble print heads, cartridges for label printers, projectors and watches, said Folkens.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>The new sensor is due to go on sale following the Automatica robotics trade fair in Munich at the end of this month.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Epson is estimated to be the world's eighth-biggest robot maker, with an installed base of 55,000 robots mainly in the electronics industry.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>Its robotics sales were 15.4 billion yen ($141 million) in the year to end-March but it aims to increase that figure to 100 billion yen by 2026, with 20 billion expected in the current year.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p> ($1 = 0.8965 euros)</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><span id="midArticle_2"/><p> (Editing by Greg Mahlich)</p><span id="midArticle_3"/></div>
