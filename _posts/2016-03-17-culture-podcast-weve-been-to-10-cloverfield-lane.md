<br><div id="start-of-content"><article class="content link-underline relative body-copy" data-js="content" itemprop="articleBody" readability="42.827828531272"><p>This week the <em>Monitor</em> podcast is full of mystery. Mysteries like, <em>What happened in </em>10 Cloverfield Lane<em>?</em> and <em>How is one Kendrick Lamar so awesome just by himself?</em> But also even deeper unsolvable quandaries like <em>Where on earth is senior editor Peter Rubin?</em> </p>



<p>OK, that last one is easy: Mr. Rubin was out covering the Game Developers Conference this week. But the rest of us were here and ready investigate the great cultural riddles of the day. And while we might not have figured out how Lamar is so talented, we take a journey to <em>10 Cloverfield Lane</em> and we think we came up with some fairly good ideas about what’s going on there. (Emphasis on the “we think.”) </p>
<p>So join us, won’t you? We’ve got editors and contributors <a href="http://www.wired.com/author/awatercutter/" target="_blank">Angela Watercutter</a> and <a href="http://www.wired.com/author/kevin-mcfarland/" target="_blank">K.M. McFarland</a>, as well as editorial fellow <a href="http://www.wired.com/author/emma_ellis/" target="_blank">Emma Grey Ellis</a>, in the Mystery Machine this week, and we’re out to solve some stuff … or at least talk about it. </p>
<p>A few helpful links for things we talk about in the podcast:</p>
