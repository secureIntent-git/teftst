<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="6"><p><span class="articleLocation">ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.</span> A Florida jury deliberated on Monday whether to slap punitive damages on the Gawker news outlet and its publisher, on top of the $115 million the media company must already pay for posting online a sex tape of the former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan. </p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>An attorney for Hogan, whose legal name is Terry Bollea, argued that a significant award would send a message above and beyond the $60 million for emotional distress and $55 million for economic damages that the jury awarded the longtime World Wrestling Entertainment star last week.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>"You can deter others. You can deter Gawker," Kenneth Turkel, the attorney for Hogan, told the jury of four women and two men in St. Petersburg, Florida, near Hogan's home.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Gawker plans to appeal the decision in a civil case that has drawn wide interest for testing boundaries between a celebrity's privacy rights and press liberties in the digital age.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>"Your message is already clear," said Michael Berry, an attorney for Gawker, calling $115 million "punishment enough."</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>He noted that sum already awarded "could be debilitating for Gawker Media."</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The jury was told that Gawker Media is worth $83 million.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Gawker CEO and publisher Nick Denton is worth about $121 million, most of which came from his share of a separate parent company that owns Gawker and holds its intellectual property, valued at $276 million. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Denton's New York condominium, savings and other personal accounts were $3.6 million of his total worth. </p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Denton and the editor responsible for the post, A.J. Daulerio, were both named in the lawsuit and can be found liable for punitive damages. Daulerio, however, had no assets and thousands of dollars in student loans, the attorneys said.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Hogan sued over Gawker's 2012 posting of a video clip that showed him having sex with the wife of his then-best friend, the radio shock jock Bubba the Love Sponge Clem. </p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Hogan, 62, testified that he did not know that their consensual tryst was being recorded when it occurred nearly a decade ago inside Clem's home.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Gawker stands a good chance of getting the verdict pared back or reversed on appeal, legal experts believe.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Gawker argued that Hogan had made his sex life fair game by publicly sharing details about it. The New York-based online publication saw its posting as protected speech under the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>The jury disagreed, finding the post violated his privacy.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><span id="midArticle_16"/><p> (Reporting by Letitia Stein; Editing by Alden Bentley)</p><span id="midArticle_17"/></div>
