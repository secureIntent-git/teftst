<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocatio&lt;/span&gt;n">New York state's financial regulator sent a letter to 28 companies this week requesting information about their online lending activities, according to a person familiar with the matter and a copy of the letter seen by Reuters.</span></p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The New York Department of Financial Services sent the letter to San Francisco-based Prosper, the second-largest online lender, as well as to Avant, Funding Circle, Upstart and others, according to the person, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The business is raising some novel questions for banking regulators, because online lenders have shunned a traditional banking model that uses deposits to make loans, and bypass  their regulations. Instead, online lenders either connect borrowers directly with retail investors who want to fund loans, or they extend credit to borrowers, then quickly bundle the loans into securities that are sold to investors.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The department demanded "immediate compliance" with New York licensing requirements for debt collection, money transmission and mortgage lending activities, according to a copy of the letter reviewed by Reuters.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Online lenders that do not believe they require New York licenses must respond with descriptions of products and services they provide to New Yorkers, as well as cash flow charts, the letter said.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>The department also requested details about types of loans and fees the companies pay to, or receive from, other financial institutions. The letter was sent out on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Funding Circle has not received a letter from the agency, but when it does receive inquiries it aims to cooperate fully and respond, spokeswoman Liz Pollock said in an email.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Upstart had not received a letter as of Friday, general counsel Alison Nicoll said in a phone call.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Avant said it received the letter and would respond in a timely fashion.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Representatives of the other companies could not be immediately reached for comment.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><span id="midArticle_11"/><p> (Reporting by Suzanne Barlyn and Michael Erman; Editing by Phil Berlowitz and Richard Chang)</p><span id="midArticle_12"/></div>
