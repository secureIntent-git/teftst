"The board members have been terrific and welcoming, the management team has been terrific and welcoming. This is no different from almost all of the companies that we get involved with."</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The founder of the activist hedge fund is coming off a major agreement struck with Yahoo last week, in a deal in which Smith and three associates joined the Internet company's board of directors after a contentious battle that nearly went to a shareholder vote.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>After more than a year of pushing for business and leadership changes at Yahoo, Starboard nominated a nine-member slate this spring to replace Yahoo's entire board. With the proxy battle now finished, the company is pressing ahead with the auction of its core business.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Smith was asked on the panel what it was like to arrive on the board of a company that has been the target of one of his firm's attacks.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"It’s much more collegial than anyone would expect" when we go into a company, he said. "This is business, it’s not personal."</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>In October 2014, Starboard won a proxy fight against Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants Inc, with shareholders supporting the activist's campaign to overthrow the company's entire board.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Smith, who was accompanied on the panel by current Darden CEO Eugene Lee, said arriving on a board with that level of shareholder mandate is extremely powerful.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>But he added that proxy fights are costly and time-consuming, and that sometimes getting inside the board room quickly is the best option.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>"It's a tough call," Smith said.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Smith was also asked about Starboard's investment in department store operator Macy's Inc, whose shares have fallen by roughly half since Starboard invested in the company last year.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Smith said the company has reduced costs and has laid out a plan to monetize its real estate, but he admitted that Starboard invested too early.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>"Sometimes you don't get the timing right," he said. </p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Starboard had $4.6 billion in assets under management as of Dec. 31, according to a regulatory filing.  </p><span id="midArticle_14"/><span id="midArticle_15"/><p> (Editing by Matthew Lewis)</p><span id="midArticle_16"/></div>
