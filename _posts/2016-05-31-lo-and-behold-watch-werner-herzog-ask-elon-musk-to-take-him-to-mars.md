<br><div id="start-of-content"><p>Werner Herzog’s new documentary, unsurprisingly, offers a very different perspective on the internet. Yes, the filmmaker talks to former hacker Kevin Mitnick and other early adopters of the web, but he also talks to cosmologists, families who think the internet is “evil,” and even Elon Musk, who he asks to take him to Mars. The <em>Grizzly Man</em> director examines smartphone usage, artificial intelligence, and tweeting monks, too. <em>Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World</em> is, in other words, a Werner Herzog documentary—and very much lives up to its name. Check out the new trailer for the doc, which hits theaters August 19.</p>
