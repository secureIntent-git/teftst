The charges, filed days before the statute of limitations on the alleged crime was to expire, are the only criminal charges the entertainer faces after more than 50 women accused him of sex assault.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Defense attorneys on Monday asked a judge to disqualify Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, District Attorney Kevin Steele from prosecuting the case, noting that he had said during his recent election campaign that he would work to charge Cosby if elected. His rival in the race made similar comments.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Officials with the Montgomery County District Attorney's office could not be reached for immediate comment on Monday.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"The charges brought on December 30, 2015 violate an express agreement made by the Montgomery County District Attorney in 2005, in which the Commonwealth agreed that Mr. Cosby would never be prosecuted with respect to the allegations of sexual assault made by complainant Andrea Constand," Cosby's attorneys said in a statement.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>

The allegations have distressed alumni and students who have been sexually assaulted, it said.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
