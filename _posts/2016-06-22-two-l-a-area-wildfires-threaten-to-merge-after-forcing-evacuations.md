        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>About 770 homes were placed under evacuation on Tuesday, no property losses or serious injuries were reported, and fire officials said late in the day that flames appeared to be creeping mainly in the direction of uninhabited wilderness areas.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>More than 1,000 firefighters were battling the conflagration, part of which was ignited by a car crash, officials said.    </p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Along the coast to the north, firefighters made steady progress in corralling the so-called Sherpa Fire, a seven-day old blaze northwest of Santa Barbara that has burned nearly 8,000 acres in an area of ranches and campgrounds. That fire was 70 percent contained as of Tuesday, authorities said.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>To the south, firefighters battled flames roaring through dry brush and chaparral near the Mexican border for a third day, prompting authorities to expand evacuation orders around the desert community of Potrero with 1,000 structures under threat.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>That fire, about 50 miles southeast of San Diego, had charred more than 6,020 acres and was 10 percent contained on Tuesday evening, California fire officials reported.    </p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
