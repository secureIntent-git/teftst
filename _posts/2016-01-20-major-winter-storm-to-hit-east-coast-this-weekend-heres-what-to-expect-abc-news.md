<p itemprop="articleBody">
A major <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/weather.htm" id="ramplink_winter storm_" target="_blank">winter storm</a> -- with the "potential" to bring historic amounts of snowfall to certain regions -- is expected to hit the East Coast this weekend, according to meteorologists at the National Weather Service.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Here's what to expect from this potential historic storm.
</p><h3> What regions of the East Coast will be impacted? </h3>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
The storm could impact East Coast regions as far south as northern North Carolina to as far north as Boston, NWS lead meteorologist Rich Otto told ABC News today.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
<strong>Mid-Atlantic Region</strong>
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
This area -- including Baltimore and <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/district-of-columbia.htm" id="ramplink_Washington, D.C_" target="_blank">Washington, D.C</a>. -- will likely be hit hardest and could "easily" see at least 1 feet of snow, - possibly even 2 feet, Otto said. He added that there was a "potential" for a historic amount of snowfall in this region.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
<strong>Southern East Coast</strong>

<p itemprop="articleBody">
Kentucky, Tennessee and parts of North Carolina are expected to get a combination of snow and freezing rain, which could create "significant icy conditions," Otto said.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
<strong>Northern East Coast</strong>
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
ABC News meteorologist Melissa Griffin said that impact to northern East Coast regions, including Boston and New York, was still unclear although "it is becoming increasingly likely that over 6 inches of snow will fall in the New York City area."
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Strong winds could also gust 30 to 50 mph. Coastal flooding is another concern in the New York City area, Griffin said.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Otto added that Boston will likely be at the outer fringe of the storm.
</p><h3> When will the storm hit? </h3>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
The storm will first hit parts of the southern East Coast, mainly Kentucky and Tennessee, on Thursday night into Friday morning before moving east toward the Mid-Atlantic, including Baltimore, DC, eastern Virginia, southeastern Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey, Otto said.

"/><span class="credit">ABC News</span></picture></div><figcaption><span class="caption">PHOTO:A graphic shows winter storm and blizzard watch areas predicted for Thursday night into Saturday. </span></figcaption></figure>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
A blizzard watch has been issued for the Mid-Atlantic region from Friday afternoon through late Saturday night, according to NWS.
</p><h3> How cold will it get? </h3>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
Temperatures will likely stay in the upper 20s to lower 30s during the storm, Otto said, adding that areas that get more of the freezing rain from the storm can see temperatures closer to 32 degrees Fahrenheit.
</p><figure class="e_image e_full" id="e_image_36399293"><div class="e_full_container"><picture><img src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1453326128_958_Major-Winter-Storm-to-Hit-East-Coast-This-Weekend-Here039s-What-to-Expect-ABC-News.jpg" border="0" width="640" height="480" alt="PHOTO:A graphic shows the snowfall predictions along the Northeast.

<p itemprop="articleBody">
Strong winds could make temperatures feel colder.
</p><h3> The bottom line </h3>
<p itemprop="articleBody">
"This is a big storm, and it's important for people to take precautions and be aware," Otto said. "This system will likely impact a lot of travel, including flights and roads, so people need to be prepared."
