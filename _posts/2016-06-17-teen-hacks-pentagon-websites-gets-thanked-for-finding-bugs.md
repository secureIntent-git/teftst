<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocation">WASHINGTON</span> High school student David Dworken spent 10 to 15 hours between classes on his laptop, hacking U.S. Defense Department websites.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Instead of getting into trouble, the 18-year-old who graduated this week was one of two people praised by Secretary of Defense Ash Carter at the Pentagon on Friday for finding vulnerabilities before U.S. adversaries did. </p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>"We know that state-sponsored actors and black-hat hackers want to challenge and exploit our networks ... what we didn't fully appreciate before this pilot was how many white hat hackers there are who want to make a difference," Carter said at a ceremony where he also thanked Craig Arendt, a security consultant at Stratum Security.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>More than 1,400 participants took part in a pilot project launched this year, and found 138 valid reports of vulnerabilities, the Pentagon said. The project invited hackers to test the cyber security of some public Defense Department websites. </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The pilot project was limited to public websites and the hackers did not have access to highly sensitive areas. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The U.S. government has pointed the finger at China and Russia, saying they have tried to access government systems in the past. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The Pentagon said it paid a total of about $75,000 to the successful hackers, in amounts ranging from $100 to $15,000.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Dworken, who graduated on Monday from Maret high school in Washington, D.C., said he reported six vulnerabilities, but received no reward because they had already been reported. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>However, Dworken said he had already been approached by recruiters about potential internships. </p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>He said some of the bugs he found would have allowed others to display whatever they wanted on the websites and steal account information. </p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Dworken, who will study computer science at Northeastern University, said his first experience with finding vulnerabilities was in 10th grade when he found bugs on his school website. </p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>"Hack the Pentagon" is modeled after similar competitions known as "bug bounties" conducted by U.S. companies to discover network security gaps.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>The Pentagon said the pilot project cost $150,000, including the reward money, and several follow up initiatives were planned. This included creating a process so others could report vulnerabilities without fear of prosecution.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>"It's not a small sum, but if we had gone through the normal process of hiring an outside firm to do a security audit and vulnerability assessment, which is what we usually do, it would have cost us more than $1 million," Carter said.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><span id="midArticle_15"/><p> (Reporting by Idrees Ali; Editing by David Gregorio)</p><span id="midArticle_16"/></div>
