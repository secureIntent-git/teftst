<br><div id=""><p>Move over, comic book heroes: “Comics’ First Superhero” (according to comics historian Don Markstein, at least) is coming to the multiplex. Yes, newspaper strip character Mandrake the Magician is <a href="http://www.tracking-board.com/sacha-baron-cohen-will-wield-the-wand-of-mandrake-the-magician-with-etan-cohen-set-to-direct-exclusive/">getting his own movie</a>, which will star Sacha Baron Cohen with Etan Cohen (no relation) attached to direct. Between this and last week’s <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/06/cape-watch-89/" target="_blank"><em>Doc Savage</em> news</a>, it seems as though studios are looking even further into the past for the next generation of blockbusters. How soon before someone pitches <em>Goliath, You Know Like the Guy in the Bible, But He’s a Good Guy</em>, do you think? While you’re pondering that, he’s a roundup of the highlights of this week’s superhero movie news.</p>
<h3>SUPER IDEA: Jeff Goldblum Being the Best Marvel Villain He Can Be</h3>
<p>Promoting <em>Independence Day: Resurgence</em>, Jeff Goldblum <a href="http://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/jeff-goldblum-talks-thor-ragnarok-grandmaster/">answered some questions</a> about his <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em> role (The Grandmaster, for those who don’t remember) and, in the process, actually made the movie seem, well, weird enough to be entertaining? “He’s a hedonist, a pleasure-seeker… an enjoyer of life and tastes and smells. I thought, ‘I can do that, I’ll bet!'” Goldblum said, adding that he’s being encouraged by director Taika Waititi to “improvise and make it my own, and that’s what I’m trying to do. I hope he doesn’t throw me out on the first day!”<br/><strong>Why this is super:</strong> In what world does “Jeff Goldblum improvs his was through playing a hedonistic near-omnipotent being” <em>not</em> sound like a recipe for a suitably insane movie? If we get a whole film of weird Goldblum riffing a bunch with Tom Hiddleston’s Loki, we’ll be satisfied and then some.</p>
<h3>CONFUSING IDEA: Spider-Man Might Be Bringing Another Guest to His <em>Homecoming</em></h3>
<p>Add yet another actor playing a mysterious role to the cast of <em>Spider-Man: Homecoming</em>, with multiple reports (<a href="http://heroichollywood.com/michael-barbieri-cast-spider-man-homecoming/">led by Heroic Hollywood</a>) saying that Michael Barbieri has signed on to join the Marvel/Sony movie. Interestingly enough, <a href="http://comicbook.com/2016/06/06/spider-man-homecoming-casts-michale-barbieri/">Comicbook.com</a> claims that Barbieri will be playing a character based on <em>Ultimate Spider-Man</em> supporting cast member Ganke Lee, which if true is… strange. It’s actually strange on a number of levels, most notably that Ganke isn’t a member of Peter Parker’s supporting cast, but that of Miles Morales, an entirely different Spider-Man, and also that Ganke is a Korean-American character and Barbieri clearly isn’t Korean-American. So, if it <em>is</em> Ganke that he’ll be playing, the question becomes “Why?”<br/><strong>Why this is confusing:</strong> To be honest, the Ganke part of these reports just seems entirely off. For one, the Peter Parker <em>Spider-Man</em> is justly recognized for its great supporting cast in superhero comics, so bringing in someone from another story seems odd. For another, adding a white guy to play a Korean-American character at a time when studios are under fire for “whitewashing” genre characters just seems like an unbelievably dumb move. But let’s wait for the official announcement to see just how wrong that might be.  </p>
<h3>SUPER IDEA: <em>Wonder Woman’</em>s Writer Going <em>Lobo</em></h3>
<p>Those rumors that <em>Wonder Woman</em> screenwriter Jason Fuchs was working on a movie based on DC Entertainment’s unstoppable bastich <em>Lobo</em>? Well, a recent Instagram post suggests that there might be something to them:</p>
<blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-version="7" readability="-16.266304347826">

</blockquote>
<p><br/><strong>Why this is super:</strong> Anyone who grew up reading Alan Grant’s <em>Lobo</em> comics—especially the original two series with Keith Giffen and Simon Bisley, which Fuchs is clearly working his way through—know that there’s a wickedly funny movie parody of the entire antihero genre to be made using the character. The only sadness is that Vin Diesel is already in cahoots with Marvel, so won’t be available to don a fright wig and take on the title role.</p>
<h3>SUPER IDEA: Rick Famuyiwa’s Flash-y Homework</h3>
<p>Also on Instagram, newly installed <em>Flash</em> director Rick Famuyiwa shared the books he’s been reading to get up to speed (<em>Get it</em>? Up to <em>spe</em>—oh, you got it) on the character:</p>
<blockquote class="instagram-media" style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-version="7" readability="-16.97311827957">
<div style="padding: 8px;" readability="6.6236559139785">

<p><a style="color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none; word-wrap: break-word;" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BGVkOI2tIia/" target="_blank">Today was a BLUR </a></p>
<p>A photo posted by Rick Famuyiwa (@rickfamuyiwa) on <time style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;" datetime="2016-06-07T02:45:10+00:00">Jun 6, 2016 at 7:45pm PDT</time></p></div>
</blockquote>
<p><br/>For those who don’t recognize spines by headers alone, the books are: <em>The Flash by Geoff Johns</em> Vols. 1-2, <em>The Flash</em> New 52 collections Vols. 1-6, <em>The Flash: Rebirth</em>, <em>Crisis on Infinite Earths</em>, and the two collections of Geoff Johns’ short-lived 2010 <em>Flash</em> series. So now you know.<br/><strong>Why this is super:</strong> Never mind the fact that Famuyiwa, who signed on to the project late last week, is likely to be a great choice for the movie. (You have all seen <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/06/dope-director-rick-famuyiwa/" target="_blank"><em>Dope</em></a>, right?) Now we have a good idea of what <em>Flash</em> will be like tonally, and those wanting to get on board with the character before the movie have a ready-made reading list.</p>
<h3>SUPER IDEA: Doctor Doom Finally Speaks Out</h3>
<p>It’s finally happened; the “<em>Fantastic Four</em> could’ve been great if only the studio hadn’t ruined it” backlash has started, with actor Toby Kebbell (Doctor Doom in the movie) <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/06/07/the-best-actor-you-may-never-recognize.html">making the opening gambit while promoting <em>Warcraft</em></a>. “I tell you, the honest truth is [Trank] did cut a great film that you’ll never see. That is a shame. A much darker version, and you’ll never see it,” he said. “I played [the villainous] Doom in three points [in the movie]: Walking down a corridor, killing the doctor, and getting into the time machine, and lying on the bench. They were the only times I played Doom. Everything else was some other guy, on some other day… doing some other thing. I was infuriated that he was allowed to limp like that!” And to make matters worse, he complained, “I missed the press tour for <em>[Dawn of the] Planet of the Apes</em> because I was lying under rubble, slowly rising out of the ashes to be Doctor Doom… Never made it to the film!”<br/><strong>Why this is super:</strong> Hey, Fox, here’s an idea. There’s almost no way you didn’t take a bath on <em>Fantastic Four</em> bombing, so why not just put the Trank cut up to rent or buy digitally so audiences can see what they missed? We’d wager most people would be willing to check out the original version after suffering through the one that made it to theaters.</p>
