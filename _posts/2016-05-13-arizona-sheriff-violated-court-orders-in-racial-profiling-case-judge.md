        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The sheriff was cited for three counts of contempt in the court’s order. Chief Deputy Gerald Sheridan was found to have committed two counts of contempt and retired Executive Chief Brian Sands and Lieutenant Joseph Sousa were cited for one count each.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Arpaio and Sheridan have admitted to violating court orders but maintained that it was unintentional. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>The lawman, who styles himself “America’s Toughest Sheriff,” and his office face a range of potential sanctions including fines, restitution for those harmed by the actions and tighter oversight of daily operations.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
