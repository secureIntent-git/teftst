<p>The last time we saw Matt Damon as Jason Bourne, in 2007’s <em>The Bourne Ultimatum</em>, he was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tuj-gPYRG28">kicking it</a> in Manhattan’s East River, having finally escaped years of of violent double-crosses, frenetic on-foot chases, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ETruidd5lQ">sidewalk-smooshing road-derbies</a>. Now, almost a decade later, Damon is back in action (and character), and as the first full trailer for this summer’s <em>Jason Bourne</em> proves, he’s out for justice, and looking for…</p>
<p>…enh, who am I kidding? I can’t even fake my way through a straight-laced, straight-faced write-up about this trailer. It’s a new <em>Bourne</em> movie! In my house, that very phrase is invoked with Oprah-like, you-get-a-new-car glee: “<em>Newwwww Boooooouuuurrrnnne Movie!!!</em>” (I live in an annoying house.) Damon’s three <em>Bourne</em> films—including 2002’s <em>The Bourne Identity</em> and 2004’s <em>The Bourne Supremacy</em>—make up one of the best action franchises of all time, a trio of globe-cavorting, camera-shaking, deeply satisfying conspiracy thrillers in which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyZU7lfGjyk&amp;t=0m53s" target="_blank">magazines become weapons</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLt7lXDCHQ0&amp;t=1m12s">bodies become wrecking balls</a>, and close allies become foes. I’ve spent the last few years hoping that Damon would return to the character, just so we could see him ingeniously K.O. some glowering-but-well-dressed Euro-goon with a box of crisps while waiting for the Metro.</p>
<p>So, let’s get to it: <em>Newww Booournee Mooovie</em>!! All we knew about <em>Jason Bourne</em> before today is that it involved cyber-crime and a lot of far-flung locales. But as the first trailer proves, it’s also about Bourne—the super-secret government agent with the wonky memory—trying to resolve his past, and helping former co-conspirator Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) when she gets caught up in a hacking conspiracy that one operative notes “could be worse than Snowden.” Cool, cool—after all, Bourne and Nicky are the classic did-they-or-didn’t-they big-screen coupling, and series director Paul Greengrass knows how to deftly expose every layer of a pulpy, powers-that-be scheme.</p>
<p>But are there also cool explosions? Yep! European motorcycle chases at night? Of course! Lots of government operatives running around a control room, trying to figure out how Bourne’s escaped them yet again?! You bet, and this time, their team includes Tommy Lee Jones and recent Oscar winner Alicia Vikander. Will they be able to contain Jason Bourne and his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBB2bPwKWVg">screeching, <em>awwwww-yeah</em>-inducing Moby theme song</a>? We’ll find out when <em>Jason Bourne</em> opens July 29.</p>
<p><strong>Pause at:</strong> 1:49, when Bourne engages in some hand-to-hand combat with the help of an old chair.<br/><strong>Essential Quote:</strong> “Why would he come back now?”—Robert Dewey (Tommy Lee Jones)</p>
