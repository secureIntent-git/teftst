        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Lynch, who will travel to the central Florida city on Tuesday to confer with investigators and meet survivors and victims' loved ones, declined to say whether a federal grand jury was likely to charge Mateen's second wife, Noor Salman, or anyone else.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>U.S. officials have said Salman knew of her husband's plans to carry out the attack on the club.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>"Because this investigation is open and ongoing, we're not commenting on anyone else's role in it right now, except to say that we are talking to everyone who knew him, and that of course includes his family, to determine what they knew, what they saw in the days and weeks leading up to this," Lynch said.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>She noted that the transcripts would be redacted to avoid causing further pain to Mateen's victims and their loved ones.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
