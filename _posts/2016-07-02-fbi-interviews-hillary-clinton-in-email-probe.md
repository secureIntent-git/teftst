<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">NEW YORK</span> Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton met with the Federal Bureau of Investigation for three and a half hours on Saturday as part of a probe of her use of a private email server while serving as secretary of state, her campaign said.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The interview at FBI headquarters in Washington followed a week of intense public focus on the investigation and on the question of Clinton's viability as a presidential candidate, which her campaign has tried for months to downplay as a distraction.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>"Secretary Clinton gave a voluntary interview this morning about her email arrangements while she was Secretary," campaign spokesman Nick Merrill said in a statement. Clinton would not comment further on her interview, he said.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Clinton is expected to be formally nominated as the Democratic candidate for the Nov. 8 presidential election at the party's convention in less than four weeks. She is currently the front-runner for the White House with polls showing her leading presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"Timing of FBI interview, between primaries and convention, probably good timing for @HillaryClinton," tweeted David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama who served as the chief strategist for his two presidential campaigns. "Best to get it behind her."</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>The FBI is investigating whether anyone in Clinton's operation broke the law as result of a personal email server kept in her Chappaqua, New York, home while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, an issue that has overshadowed her campaign.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Clinton and her staff have struggled to respond to accusations that her use of the server in violation of State Department protocol means she is untrustworthy. Trump has said the investigation should disqualify her from being president. Trump's spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not respond to a request for comment.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Clinton held a nine-point lead over Trump in a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Republican lawmakers have called for an independent investigation, saying they do not trust the Justice Department to handle the inquiry with impartiality. Republicans, Trump, intensified their criticism of the process on Thursday after Attorney General Loretta Lynch met privately this week with Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, at an airport. </p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Lynch said the two did not discuss the probe, but that she acknowledged the meeting was inappropriate and would accept whatever recommendations the career prosecutors working on the case made about whether to prosecute Clinton.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><span id="midArticle_11"/><p> (Editing by Mary Milliken)</p><span id="midArticle_12"/></div>
