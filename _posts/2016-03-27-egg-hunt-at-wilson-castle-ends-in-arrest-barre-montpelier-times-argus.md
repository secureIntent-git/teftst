ShaAsia Jones, of Rutland, guided by Francie Ettori, a freshman at Rutland High School, look for eggs at the Rutland High School Alumni Field Saturday afternoon. Members of the varsity, junior varsity and middle school lacrosse teams shared sticks with their partners and assisted as they cleared the field of eggs.</p>

PROCTOR  Two law enforcement agencies were called to the scene and one man was pepper-sprayed and then arrested when tensions escalated at an over-booked Easter egg hunt on Saturday at Wilson Castle.</p><p>The Rutland County Sheriffs Department received a call about multiple irate parents at the 19th-century estate at about 1:40 p.m., Sgt. Andrew Cross said, and were asked to come so it didnt get too out of control.</p><p>Arriving on scene about five minutes later, two officers attempted to mediate conversations between angry parents and event organizers, he said. The Vermont State Police were also called to assist.</p><p>But one man  Michael Cuthbertson, 34, of Newbury  turned his anger on law enforcement and began making threats when they tried to intervene, Cross said.</p><p>After he was told he was under arrest, he began to flee, he said.</p><p>Cuthbertson was pepper sprayed, chased into a nearby meadow, pepper sprayed again, and then finally subdued, Cross said. A police baton was displayed but not used in the chase for Cuthbertson, Cross said.</p><p>The Newbury man was charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, Cross said, and is cited to appear in Rutland criminal court Monday. He was released from custody Saturday.</p><p>Roughly 1,200 to 1,500 turned out for the event, according to Jeremy Griffin, the co-owner of the Rutland-based Party OutFitters company, which organized the event. </p><p>Youve got to allow some space for hiccups, he said.</p><p>We did have some people that were upset. We had to do some refunds, Griffin added.</p><p>His wife, Party OutFitters co-owner Danielle Desrochers, said the trouble started when some participants started too early, scooped up all the eggs and left none for those still in line.</p><p>People broke through the ropes for the egg hunt before the scheduled time for it to start. So some people were not entered into the event yet, waiting for it to start, with their tickets already bought when that happened, she said.</p><p>I think when you get a lot of people at an Easter egg hunt, the kids, they get excited. Its hard to see the eggs on the ground and to be told to wait. And once a few start, they all start.</p><p>Many attendees took to social media, complaining of general dysfunction at the event. People waited in line for hours and the bounce house deflated with children inside, multiple Facebook users wrote on the pages for Wilson Castle and Party OutFitters.</p><p>Carmen Thompson, of Proctor, posted that she was feeling annoyed on the Wilson Castle Facebook page.</p><p>Omg the line at this event is crazy, standing in mud at Wilson Castle, hope we get in time for egg hunt, she wrote. </p><p>Even more flooded the Party OutFitters Facebook page with irate comments, some complaining organizers wouldnt refund their tickets.</p><p>How do we get a refund? Ordered on line few weeks ago and am very upset ... no eggs ...no Easter bunny and kids saw stuff they did not need too (sic)! Plus the bouncy house deflating with kids in it  I want a refund, wrote Kristi Alexander, of Burlington.</p><p>Lucas Virgil, a volunteer with Wilson Castle, said the museum was planning to release a statement at a later date. </p><p>The Castle was only responsible for security and parking, Virgil said, and did not organize the event.</p><p>We are running all our own events from now on, he said. Theres a lot of positive things coming.</p><p>lola.duffort @rutlandherald.com<br /></p></div>
