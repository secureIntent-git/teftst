<br><div id="start-of-content"><article class="content link-underline relative body-copy" data-js="content" itemprop="articleBody" readability="46.614747307374"><p>The great outdoors! Pinecones crunching beneath your boots, pup tents flapping in the breeze, a wood-fired pizza oven that doubles as a phone charger. You know, all the classics.</p>
<p>Packing up the <a href="http://www.bioliteenergy.com/products/pizza-dome">Biolite PizzaDome</a> for your next camping adventure admittedly isn’t exactly roughing it. It’s also an extension of the company’s $300 <a href="http://www.bioliteenergy.com/products/biolite-basecamp">BaseCamp stove</a>, so the Dome’s $70 price tag belies a heftier cost to cover the whole experience. Still! What is the steady march of technological progress for if not oneness with both nature and a piping fresh, thin-crust margherita pie? </p>
<p>The PizzaDome can take up to 15 minutes to warm up, and you can track the temp with a built-in thermometer. It also comes with a ceramic pizza stone (or flatbread stone, or whatever member of the “stretched dough” family you prefer), because being in the forest doesn’t mean you have to settle for uneven crusts like some sort of animal.</p>
<p>As for the BaseCamp stove itself, its attached battery pack can charge your phone in a pinch. After all, if a pizza bakes in a forest and no one’s around to Instagram it, did ever bake at all?</p>
