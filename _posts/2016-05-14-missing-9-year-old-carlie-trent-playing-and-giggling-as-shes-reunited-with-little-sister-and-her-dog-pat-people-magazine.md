<br><div id="articleBody" readability="100.47115716753">Following her safe return home, 9-year-old Carlie Trent, who had been <a href="http://www.people.com/article/missing-tennessee-girl-uncle-allgedly-amber-alert" target="_blank">missing since May 4 after being allegedly kidnapped by her uncle</a>, couldn't wait to be reunited with her family – especially her little sister and her dog Pat.
<p>According to <a href="http://www.11alive.com/news/watch-carlie-trents-reunion-with-her-little-sister/190573429" target="_blank">NBC affiliate 11 Alive</a> the Rogersville girl was seen "playing and giggling" with her younger sister Katie on a trampoline as she returned home after spending the night at a Johnson City hospital.&#13;
</p><p>Her aunt Linda Simpson – married to Gary Simpson, who is charged with aggravated kidnapping for allegedly taking Carlie from school – was waiting for her along with several cousins, the network reports.  &#13;
</p><p>Carlie <a href="http://www.people.com/article/carlie-trent-missing-found-allegedly-kidnapped" target="_blank">was rescued</a> at about 4:45 p.m. on Thursday in a remote area off Gravely Valley Road near the Hancock County line, <a href="http://www.people.com/people/package/article/0,,20981907_21006347,00.html" target="_blank">PEOPLE confirmed earlier Friday</a>. &#13;
</p><p><!-- insert ssi-->Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Director Mark Gwyn told reporters at a press conference that Carlie was rescued when two Hawkins County residents – identified by TBI officials as Stewart Franklin and Donnie Lawson – were checking property owned by one of them and saw Carlie and her alleged kidnapper, Gary Simpson, 57, deep in the woods off Debord Road.&#13;

The two were part of a four-member group of men who went searching for the 9-year-old and then split up into pairs, the spokesperson says.
<p>"We are sure that the family of Carlie Trent sends its heartfelt thanks for their actions today," Gwyn told reporters.&#13;
</p><p>Franklin told <a href="http://wjhl.com/2016/05/12/rescuers-of-carlie-trent-something-kept-telling-us-to-come-back-to-gravely-valley/" target="_blank">WJHL</a> that Carlie was walking around with a teddy bear when he and Lawson found her. &#13;

And they were. I think this is a clear message that we should send to the public – that we've got to have your help in these type of cases."&#13;
</p><p>On May 4, Simpson picked Carlie up from her Rogersville elementary school. Simpson and Carlie did not return home later that afternoon and the following day an Amber Alert was issued in Tennessee. &#13;
</p><p>On Friday, Carlie's aunt Linda said they're going to give her some space to recover. "We just have to let Carlie do as she wants too," she <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/kidnapped-tennessee-girl-carlie-trent-returns-home-n574011" target="_blank">told WCYB</a>.
