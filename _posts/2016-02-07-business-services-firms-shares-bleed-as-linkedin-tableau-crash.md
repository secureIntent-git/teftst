<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocation">NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO</span> Dismal sales outlooks from marquee technology names sent shares in the enterprise sector crashing on Friday as investors questioned whether information-technology managers would keep spending on their products.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The uncertainty spread into the broader industry, sending the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index down 3.25 percent to 4363.144. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.29 percent to 16,204.97.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Business-analytics company Tableau Software (<span id="symbol_DATA.N_0">DATA.N</span>) shed half its market value a day after cutting its full-year earnings guidance to between 22 cents and 35 cents a share, around half the 57 cents analysts had expected. Tableau shares closed down 49.4 percent at $41.33.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The company had cut its full-year 2016 revenue forecast to $830 million to $850 million from prior guidance of $845 million to $865 million. And Tableau's fourth-quarter revenue of $202.8 million only narrowly beat analyst expectations of $200.8 million. </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>"When you get a company that barely beats that has (previously) been beating by a longshot, people are going to be scratching their heads a little bit," said Brian White, analyst at Drexel Hamilton. "If that guy can’t show much upside, what does that mean for the rest of the sector?"</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Tableau's results came in tandem with poor performance from business network LinkedIn, which shocked Wall Street with a revenue forecast that fell far short of expectations. Its shares plunged 44 percent on Friday, exacerbating the rout in business-services companies.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>"They're a proxy for enterprise spend," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR, about LinkedIn.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Investors wondered whether enterprise customers will be willing to splurge on trends like big-data analytics and cloud computing. Those trends, hyped heavily over the years by analysts and the companies themselves, had previously driven big share-price gains.  </p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>"If you’re uncertain how much is something worth, you’re going to give the lowest bargain-basement price," said analyst Katherine Egbert at Piper Jaffray. </p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Companies that sell cloud-based software, meaning Internet-delivered software bought on a metered basis rather than paid for upfront, also saw particularly sharp declines. </p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Business-software companies Salesforce.com (<span id="symbol_CRM.N_1">CRM.N</span>) and Workday (<span id="symbol_WDAY.N_2">WDAY.N</span>) fell more than 10 percent each. Salesforce's 13.6 percent drop was its worst one-day loss since October 2008. </p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Shares of Splunk Inc (<span id="symbol_SPLK.O_3">SPLK.O</span>), a data analytics software maker, closed down 23 percent at $36.23.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Companies that help businesses update their information-technology infrastructure also slumped. Microsoft dropped 3.5 percent to $50.16, while Amazon.com Inc (<span id="symbol_AMZN.O_4">AMZN.O</span>) fell 6.4 percent to $502.13.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Others taking hits included Qlik Technologies (<span id="symbol_QLIK.O_5">QLIK.O</span>), Cornerstone OnDemand (<span id="symbol_CSOD.O_6">CSOD.O</span>), Hortonworks (<span id="symbol_HDP.O_7">HDP.O</span>) and Teradata (<span id="symbol_TDC.N_8">TDC.N</span>), which dropped between 8 and 17 percent. </p><span id="midArticle_14"/><span id="midArticle_15"/><p> (Reporting by Sarah McBride, Lance Tupper and <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=saqib.ahmed&amp;">Saqib Iqbal Ahmed</a>; Editing by Dan Grebler and Meredith Mazzilli)</p><span id="midArticle_16"/></div>
