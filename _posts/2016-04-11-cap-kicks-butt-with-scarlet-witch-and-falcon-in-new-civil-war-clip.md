<p>“What if Superman had decided to fly down, rip off the roof of the White House, and grab the President right out of the Oval Office?” asks a government official at the beginning of the new clip, which aired tonight during the MTV Movie Awards. “Who would have stopped him?” The answer, of course, is Task Force X, aka the titular Suicide Squad—and the gang’s all here: The Joker (Jared Leto), Enchantress (Cara Delevingne), Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie), Rick Flag (Joel Kinnaman), Deadshot (Will Smith), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), Slipknot (Adam Beach), El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), and Katana (Karen Fukuhara). While the new clip features a fair bit of footage we’ve seen before, there’s plenty of new stuff as well, from the Squad undergoing basic training (or whatever you’d call a bunch of supervillains on a military base) to Deadshot coaxing a firestorm out of El Diablo, to a few new zingers from Harley—and even new footage of Leto’s Joker, which is shaping it up to be just as creepy as <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/01/19/jared-leto-joker-suicide-squad/79008872/" target="_blank">his on-set behavior</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Pause at:</strong> 0:20 for Ike Barinholtz as whatever as-yet-unnamed guard he’s playing; 1:05 for some serious Katana; 1:31 for Captain Boomerang slicing his way through a firefight while holding onto a stuffed unicorn (!); 1:45 for a little bit of Batfleck.<br/><strong>Song:</strong> Grace feat. G-Eazy, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7_PqrQsNRg" target="_blank">“You Don’t Own Me”</a>; Sweet, “Ballroom Blitz”<br/><strong>Essential Quote:</strong> “I’m known to be quite vexing…I’m just forewarning you.” —Harley Quinn</p>
