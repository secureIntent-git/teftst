"It was hard to figure out what was really happening. That's when I looked out the window and I saw this van and a gentleman on the ground, and I saw other people chasing the van."</p><p>Hallock said the plane shook when it was struck by the van. Damage could be seen to one of the plane's wings.</p><p>State police said the driver of a Swiss Port delivery van was driving near Gate C 11 when he failed to put the vehicle in park before he got out of the van. When he realized the van was moving, he tried to stop it as it rolled toward the plane.</p><p>“This attempt was unsuccessful, and the operator fell to the ground. The van struck the wing of the JetBlue aircraft, causing damage to the aircraft and the van,” State Police said in a statement.<br/></p><p>The van operator was injured, police said.<br/></p><p>A second Swiss Port employee who was in the area was then able to regain control of the van. State Police personnel responded to the scene.<br/></p><p>“(The van) rolled underneath the airplane, and luckily they got it to stop before it hit another airplane,” a crew member told passengers.<br/></p><p>The incident happened as the plane was about to depart for Tampa.<br/></p><p>"The plane did sustain damage and has been taken out of service. Massport Fire and Rescue and the Massachusetts State Police responded. The cause of the incident remains under investigation," Massport said in a statement.<br/></p><p>Passengers on the flight were accommodated on a different aircraft, JetBlue said.</p>
