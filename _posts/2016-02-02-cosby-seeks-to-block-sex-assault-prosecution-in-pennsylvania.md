<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="6"><p><span class="articleLocation">NORRISTOWN, Pa.</span> Comedian Bill Cosby on Tuesday sought to derail Pennsylvania prosecutors' effort to make him stand trial on sexual assault charges, contending that a deal reached over a decade ago gave him immunity from prosecution.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>An entertainer who built a career on family-friendly comedy, Cosby now faces accusations from more than 50 women that he sexually assaulted them, often after plying them with drugs and alcohol, in a series of attacks dating to the 1960s.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Prosecutors late last year charged Cosby, 78, with sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, a former basketball coach at his alma mater Temple University, just days before the statue of limitations to bring charges ran out.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Constand's allegations are the only ones to have resulted in criminal charges against the actor, although Cosby also faces a series of civil lawsuits related to alleged rapes.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Cosby has long denied wrongdoing, and his lawyers have asked Common Pleas Court Judge Steven O'Neill to dismiss the Constand case.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>At a pretrial hearing on Cosby's dismissal motion, former Montgomery County District Attorney Bruce Castor testified on Tuesday that he decided in 2005 not to bring charges over the Constand allegations.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Castor, called to testify by Cosby's lawyers, said he feared her credibility as a witness could have been undermined because she waited a year to file her criminal complaint against Cosby and hired a lawyer to explore a civil lawsuit. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"I decided that because of defects in the case, the case could not be won and that I was going to make a decision that we would not prosecute Mr. Cosby," Castor said during a hearing in a suburban Philadelphia court.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>"Making Mr. Cosby pay money to Ms. Constand was the best I would be able to set the stage for because a prosecution was not viable and never would be."</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>TESTIMONY UNSEALED</p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>In his testimony, Castor said his decision not to prosecute Cosby prevented the entertainer from invoking his constitutional right against self-incrimination when he gave a deposition for a civil suit against Constand.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>A judge last year unsealed that testimony, in which Cosby acknowledged giving Benadryl, an anti-allergy medication, to Constand in 2004 but portrayed the encounter as consensual.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Constand, now 44, said Cosby plied her with drugs and alcohol before sexually assaulting her.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/>
