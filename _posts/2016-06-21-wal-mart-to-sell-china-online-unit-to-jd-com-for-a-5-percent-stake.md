<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocatio&lt;/span&gt;n">Wal-Mart Stores Inc said on Monday it plans to sell its Chinese e-commerce business Yihaodian to Chinese online retailer JD.com Inc for a 5 percent equity stake in JD.com, a strategic alliance that aims to expand WalMart's reach in China to more customers.</span></p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Under the deal, JD.com will issue about 145 million new class A shares to Wal-Mart, worth about $1.5 billion at JD.com's current valuation.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Shares of Wal-Mart rose 26 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $71.21 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading. JD.com's ADRs were up nearly 8 percent, or $1.56, at $21.58</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Wal-Mart took a stake in Yihaodian, which has focused on online grocery sales and caters to affluent female customers, in 2011 before taking full ownership last July.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>That deal combined Yihaodian's local expertise with Wal-Mart's global sourcing and supply chain capabilities, but growth was hindered when Wal-Mart narrowed the number of sellers on the site, according to a note from Barclays issued on Monday.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>In the latest agreement, JD.Com, China's second-largest online retailer, will control the Yihaodian brand and website, while Walmart will continue to operate the Yihaodian direct sales business and will sell on the Yihaodian marketplace.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The deal will give Walmart access to JD.Com's online traffic and expand its reach into the Chinese market. Sam's Club China will open a flagship store on JD.Com and utilize its delivery network, the companies said. Walmart’s China stores will be listed as a preferred retailer on JD.com’s crowd-sourced platform, O2O JV Dada.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Brian Yarbrough, an analyst with Edward Jones, said the deal with JD.com was a more cost-effective way for Wal-Mart to get its products and name in the marketplace by partnering with a large, experienced player.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>"It doesn't mean that they've pulled away, but to me it tells me they are trying to make smarter investments," said Yarbrough. </p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Walmart’s financial adviser on the deal was Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. LLC and its legal advisor was  Morrison &amp; Foerster LLP. JD.com’s legal advisors were Orrick Herrington Sutcliffe LLP and Han Kun Law Offices.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><span id="midArticle_11"/><p> (Reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bengaluru; Additonal reporting by Rishika Sadam and Liana B.
