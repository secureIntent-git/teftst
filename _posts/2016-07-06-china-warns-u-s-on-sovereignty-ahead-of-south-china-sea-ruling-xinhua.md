U.S. officials say the U.S. response should China stick to its vow to ignore the ruling could include stepped up freedom-of-navigation patrols close to Chinese claimed islands in what is one of the world's business trade routes.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>In his call with Kerry, Wang "urged the United States to honor its commitment to not to take sides on issues related to sovereign disputes, to be prudent with its actions and words, and not to take any actions that infringe upon the sovereignty and security interests of China," Xinhua said.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Wang said that regardless of the tribunal's ruling, China would "firmly safeguard its own territorial sovereignty and legitimate maritime rights and firmly safeguard the peace and stability," Xinhua said.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Wang also said that relations between China and the United States were generally on a sound track and that the two sides should further focus on cooperation while properly managing their differences.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>The U.S. State Department confirmed that Kerry had spoken by phone to Wang, but gave no details.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>

        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>U.S. officials say they fear China may respond to the ruling from The Hague by declaring an air defense identification zone in the South China Sea, as it did in the East China Sea in 2013, and by stepping up its building and fortification of artificial islands.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><span id="midArticle_10"/><p> (Reporting by David Brunnstrom; Editing by Sandra Maler)</p><span id="midArticle_11"/></div>
