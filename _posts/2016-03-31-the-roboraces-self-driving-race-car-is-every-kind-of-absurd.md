<br><div id="start-of-content"><p>If Formula One cars <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/02/relentless-tinkering-makes-f1-cars-look-funky/">resemble those crazy birds-of-paradise</a>, subject to the whims of evolution, the Roborace car looks like a fish you’d find <a href="http://video.wired.com/watch/some-fish-swim-weirder-fish-hop-this-fish-_waddles_">waddling around a cave</a>—built to fit a world that has little in common with the one humans know.</p>
<p>The global motorsports series, created by UK VC fund Kinetik, is set to launch next year as part of Formula E, the <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/09/formula-e-electric-racing/">all-electric racing series</a> now in its second season. Roborace, which just unveiled the design for its race cars, is meant to promote <a href="http://www.wired.com/tag/autonomous-vehicles/">autonomous driving</a> and offer software developers a high-profile, competitive venue for honing their work.</p>
<p>The teams will share hardware—everyone gets the same car—but develop their own software. After all, that’s the stuff that matters when it comes to navigating a crowded track at speeds nearing 200 mph.</p>
<p>The car is the work of Daniel Simon, a designer who started a conventional career at Volkswagen’s empire, working for Audi, Bentley, and Bugatti. He’s spent the past decade <a href="http://danielsimon.com/wallpapers/">doing his own thing</a>, styling liveries for Formula One cars and working as a consultant folks for like Disney. If you’ve seen his work, it’s likely in a movie theater: Simon created vehicles for films like <em>Prometheus</em>, <em>Captain America</em>, and <em>Tron Legacy</em>.</p>
<p>It’s a fitting CV for a job that involves self-driving race cars. Automakers have started to address the idea of <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/07/bit-barf-can-teach-us-lots-self-driving-cars/">how taking the wheel from humans might change how cars are built</a>, but this takes the extra step of taking the human out of the picture altogether. It’s a very cool-looking future.</p>
<p>Don’t care about human racing, let alone what happens when robots swarm the circuit? There’s good news for you, too. Teaching these cars how to race <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/12/roborace-autonomous-vehicle-racing/">could help advance the systems consumers will one day use</a>.</p>
