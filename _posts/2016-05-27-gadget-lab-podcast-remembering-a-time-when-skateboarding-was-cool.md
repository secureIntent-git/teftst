<br><div id="start-of-content"><article class="content link-underline relative body-copy border-b pad-b-50" data-js="content" itemprop="articleBody" readability="38.506393861893"><p>We’ve been anticipating these last two weeks for decades. Within eight days of each other, the <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/03/oculus-rift-review-virtual-reality/">Oculus Rift</a> and <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/04/timelapse-video-set-up-htc-vive/">HTC Vive</a> were released to the public. It was a huge, huge fortnight for VR, as the promise of computer-generated reality finally arrived in our specially-prepared living rooms. On this week’s show, David and Michael look at where we are in consumer VR. Is one of the headsets better than the other? Are there any cool games yet? And now that everything’s in our hands, what do we have to look forward to next?</p>



<p>A couple of notes. First, check out Chris Kohler’s review of the VR videogame, <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/04/gallery-call-of-starseed-review/"><em>Call of the Starseed</em></a>, which is discussed this week. Second, David’s unicycle-riding commute buddy really needs to reach out. See this part right below here where we list our Twitter handles? We’d love to have you on the show.</p>
