<br><div id=""><p>Viral marketing may be the cool kid way to promote movies these days, but that isn’t stopping <em>Batman v Superman</em>—the earnest dad of the current superhero franchises—from trying to keep it real. If <em>Deadpool</em>‘s campaign was an <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/02/deadpool-marketing/" target="_blank">off-the-wall, over-the-top</a> cross-platform marketing bonanza, <em>Batman v Superman</em>‘s is a by-the-book, cover-all-bases exercise that feels a little…rote. Getting a Twitter shoutouts from Turkish Airlines will never be quite as much fun as a poop emoji billboard.</p>
<p>And despite <a href="http://deadline.com/2016/03/batman-v-superman-advance-ticket-sales-pacing-ahead-deadpool-avengers-furious-7-1201720435/" target="_blank">strong advance ticket sales</a>, the narrative that has emerged ahead of the movie’s Friday release seems not to be “OMG we can’t wait!” but “<a href="http://variety.com/2016/film/news/wb-batman-v-superman-faces-high-expectations-1201729887/" target="_blank">will BvS break even?</a>” Is this the marketing team’s fault? Probably not; It’s been a while since DC Comics has had a winner, and if you only have the energy for one <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/03/cape-watch-superhero-feuds-make-hard-pick-sides/" target="_blank">superhero feud movie</a> this year, <em>Captain America: Civil War</em> frankly <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/03/captain-america-civil-war-trailer-spider-man/" target="_blank">looks like more fun</a>.</p>
<p>Granted, not all of the marketing for <em>Batman v Superman</em> (which has the unique distinction of being edgier <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/03/batman-v-superman-rom-com/" target="_blank">as a rom-com)</a> has been bad. It started out in the superhero-movie- marketing sweet spot: feel-good charity work. <em>Batman v Superman</em>‘s version of sending Chris Pratt to a hospital to be adorable has been this Omaze charity contest (you donate money to charity for a chance to win prizes like a ride in the Batmobile with Ben Affleck).</p>
<p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AaZhwaddrUM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""/></p>
<p>The other cool thing they’ve done is what seems to be the first storytelling enterprise to utilize the <a href="http://www.wired.com/tag/amazon-echo" target="_blank">Amazon Echo</a>. Amazon partnered with Warner Bros to bring you a interactive murder mystery radio show called “The Wayne Investigation,” in which you and Alexa navigate Gotham in the wake of Bruce Wayne’s parents being killed. It’s basically high tech story time, and has the same kind of wacky charm as Morgan Freeman suddenly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1h1Jh8hba8">being the voice of Waze</a>.</p>
<p>But then things started to get weird when the campaign turned into a world-building exercise. Sorry, we misspoke: a <em>self-serious</em> world-building exercise.</p>
<h3>Lex Luthor and LexCorp</h3>
<p>Not everyone was happy with Jesse Eisenberg being cast as Lex Luthor—after all, his particular brand of menace isn’t as global as it is…well, Sand Hill Road, we guess. <em>Batman v Superman</em>, though, is leaning into the idea that the Internet loves to hate a sinister tech bro. But rather than using this angle to revitalize the oft-told tales of Batman or Superman, the marketing department is capitalizing on Lex’s smug-millennial sneer to take over social media. In order to make Lex Luthor Jr. seem more like a real person, he got a Twitter account. Sort of.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" readability="7.98">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">This Thanksgiving, I’m thankful for the loved ones I have around me and the ones that I don’t.</p>
<p>— Lex Luthor (@alexanderluthor) <a href="https://twitter.com/alexanderluthor/status/669926621944479745">November 26, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p>That gem is one of just seven tweets from the account, which seems to have ridden off into the Metropolis sunset in December.(Full disclosure: the seventh happens to be a retweet of a story from WIRED Insider, a promotional arm of WIRED.)  Lex Luthor Jr. is also the subject of a couple of fake magazine profiles. There’s one on <a href="http://fortune.com/contentfrom/2015/10/5/lex-luthor-jr/ntv_a/3dsBA58oDAfxgFA/" target="_blank">Fortune</a> that talks about Luthor eating a pizza with raw almond crust and calls him a “jeans-wearing genius.” (Full disclosure again: The other piece is sponsored content on WIRED, and is a <a href="http://www.wired.com/brandlab/2015/12/lexical-analysis-lex-luthor-on-disrupting-the-vigilante-industrial-complex/" target="_blank">fictional Q&amp;A</a> between Lex Luthor and a <em>Daily Planet </em>reporter<em>.</em>) </p>
<p>Lex Luthor (and his business concern, LexCorp) has furthered his real-world footprint by providing free WiFi at New York Comic Con, and launching <a href="https://www.lexcorp.io/" target="_blank">a LexCorp website</a> extolling the virtues of “the world’s first neural network based operating system.”</p>

<h3>Gotham and Metropolis</h3>
<p>The marketing campaign’s other focal points have been Gotham and Metropolis. We’ll say this for the rollout: where <em>Deadpool</em>‘s was a scattershot approach to marketing, <em>BvS</em> is clearly unafraid to take a deep, nerdy dive. Example: They pulled together a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1846709806/?tag=w050b-20" target="_blank"><em>Time Out</em> guide to Gotham and Metropolis</a> that’s basically just 128 pages of easter eggs.</p>
<figure attachment_1991676="" class="wp-caption landscape alignnone  relative" data-js="fader"><a href="http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/TimeOutGotham1.jpg"><img src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1458649209_654_Batman-v-Supermans-Marketing-Seems-Super-Dadcore.jpg" alt="TimeOutGotham1.jpg" width="482" height="385" class="size-text-column-width wp-image-1991676"/></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text link-underline"><span class="credit link-underline-sm"><span aria-hidden="true" class="ui ui ui-photo inline-block ui-credit relative opacity-6 marg-r-sm marg-l-sm no-caption"/>TimeOut</span></figcaption></figure><p>Kinda fun, but it also costs about nine dollars (and shipping time alone is definitely going to still any viral momentum it might have had).</p>
<p>Thankfully, <em>Time Out</em> isn’t the only (completely random) company Warner Bros. teamed up with. You probably saw the back-to-back Super Bowl ads with Bruce Wayne and Lex Luthor trying to sell you on Gotham and Metropolis as tourist destinations. As Super Bowl ads, they made <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/02/best-worst-super-bowl-commercials/" target="_blank">neither our best nor worst list</a>, and we kinda don’t buy the idea that either of these guys flies a commercial airline. (<em>You</em> try picturing Bruce Wayne at baggage claim.) But as a commercial, sure, why not? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpk8eSpRBnY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TReIozZ1b10</p>
<p>Forgive us for saying so, but these ads are a master class in missed opportunities. There are plenty of fun gag—Jeremy Irons as Alfred in a flight attendant outfit, Superman flying—but instead, we get Turkish Airlines highlighting the dullest possible parts of travel: </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" readability="4.77"><p>

</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" readability="5.1">

<p>We’re still rooting for these guys to pull off what is already a big ask, but please, Warner, don’t tell us about Clark Kent’s checked baggage fees.</p>
