<br><div id=""><p><em><cite>We’re on the road this week in Iowa, documenting the run-up to the Iowa Caucuses on February 1 and how technology and innovation are changing longstanding traditions in American politics.</cite></em></p>
<p>During last night’s presidential debate, the Republican candidates on stage, along with the Fox News moderators invoked the term “ISIS” a whopping 40 times. Various forms of the word “terror”—terrorist, terrorism—were used nearly 30 times. The term “jobs,” by contrast, came up just six times.</p>
<p>The opposite was true as Hillary Clinton delivered an address before a group of Iowans today at Grand View University in Des Moines. Just days before the Iowa caucus, the former Secretary of State, who often touts her foreign policy chops, chose to put jobs and American incomes at the center of the discussion, with only a passing mention of the threat of global terrorism. </p>

</p>

<p>“There’s a big difference between being on the Democratic side and the Republican candidates,” she said, and, well, we can’t disagree. </p>
<p>As primary season closes in, the divide between the issues each party is choosing to prioritize is widening, with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Clinton zeroing in on issues like wages and healthcare, as Republican candidates double down on issues related to immigration and foreign threats.</p>
<p>Much of Clinton’s plan to increase employment hinges on modernizing the country’s crumbling infrastructure, investing in clean energy technology, and encouraging businesses to invest in and train workers in new manufacturing skills. On that last point, the former first lady mentioned a visit to Black Hawk Community College, where she encountered a giant 3D printer. (In reality, it was a tech training center in Waterloo, Iowa. According to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/01/29/hillary-clinton-and-the-huge-3d-printer/" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>, Clinton muddled the details.) </p>
<p>“They bought the biggest 3D printer in North America, because they’re thinking about the future,” Clinton said. “They’re training people how to use that. These advanced manufacturing jobs, they’re going to take a lot of skill, and we need to be ready.”</p>
<p>Throughout all of her speeches, Clinton has reserved the most criticism for her Republican counterparts. But as the Democratic race in Iowa gets tighter and tighter, she pointedly acknowledged today what she believes are the stark differences between herself and Sanders, namely, their approaches to healthcare. </p>
<p>Clinton has repeatedly framed Sanders’ Medicare-for-all proposal as overly idealistic and impossible to pull off. She clings to this issue because, while the distinction between Republican and Democratic priorities may be clear, the distinction between Clinton’s proposals and Sanders’ is far more blurry. And so, in her final pitches in Iowa this weekend, Clinton is putting a philosophical choice before voters: pragmatism or idealism?</p>
<p>“I’m not running on just telling you what you want to hear,” she said, in an obvious nod to Sanders. “I’m running on what I think I can do.” </p>
