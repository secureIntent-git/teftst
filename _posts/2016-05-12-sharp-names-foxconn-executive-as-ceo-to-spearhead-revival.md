<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">TOKYO/TAIPEI</span> Japan's Sharp Corp has named a top Foxconn executive as CEO and said it would seal a $3.5 billion stake sale to the Taiwanese firm ahead of schedule, as the display maker seeks a return to profit in the face of slowing smartphone sales.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Sharp said Foxconn Vice Chairman Tai Jeng-wu will succeed Kozo Takahashi, becoming the first outsider to lead the century-old firm that began making belt buckles and mechanical pencils.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The change marks a new chapter for Sharp which has struggled to remain competitive even after two massive bank bailouts. The firm and its Japanese peers have been out-manoeuvred by upstart Asian rivals, with companies once synonymous with cutting-edge electronics such as Sony Corp losing cache.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>For Sharp, a revival beckons under the leadership of Tai, a 30-year veteran of Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics manufacturer. Tai has extensive experience running Foxconn's Shenzhen operations and played a central role in the stake negotiations, people at Foxconn told Reuters.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>"Tai is No. 2 at Hon Hai. He speaks Japanese. He was selected from a comprehensive perspective," Takahashi said at an earnings briefing, referring to Foxconn by its formal name, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Tai will be one of nine new board members, Takahashi said.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>He also said Sharp aims to finalize the sale of a two-thirds stake to Foxconn by the end of June, ahead of their initial Oct. 5 deadline.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Sharp shares closed down 0.8 percent before the announcement whereas the Nikkei benchmark index rose 0.4 percent.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>APPLE TIES</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Sharp will get a boost from a takeover that would vastly expand sales channels for its displays. In return, Foxconn will gain control of Sharp's advanced display technology and strengthen its pricing power with Apple Inc, a major client of both companies.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Foxconn's display-making affiliate Innolux Corp will also benefit from cooperation with Sharp, Innolux's chairman said separately on Thursday. He also announced his resignation to take an as-yet undetermined role at Sharp.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Even with Foxconn's support, however, Sharp will still have difficulty competing, especially as Chinese display makers have been aggressively expanding capacity, analysts said.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Sharp also lags South Korean rivals in organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology, which Apple is widely expected to adopt for future versions of its iPhone devices.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>But Foxconn chief Terry Gou has expressed preference for Sharp's strength in indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) technology.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>"IGZO is Sharp's pride," said Innolux Chairman H.C. Tuan. "I am hopeful we can cooperate with Sharp in this area."</p><span id="midArticle_0"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Still, Sharp's Takahashi said over-reliance on smartphones was one reason for deteriorating earnings.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>"We've failed to move fast enough" to shift focus to larger panels, Takahashi said at the briefing.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Sharp reported a second consecutive annual operating loss of 162 billion yen ($1.5 billion) for the business year ended March, more than triple the loss of the year earlier.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Continued focus on smartphones does not bode well after Apple reported its first ever decline in iPhone sales in January-March, and iPhone assembler Foxconn reported an 8.5 percent decline in sales in April.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Foxconn subsidiary FIH Mobile Ltd, whose clients include Sony and Xiaomi Inc [XTC.UL], also said earlier this month that its first-half profit may fall as much as 92 percent as smartphone sales growth slows to a single digit this year.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><span id="midArticle_6"/><p> (Reporting by Makiko Yamazaki in TOKYO and J.R.
