        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Sharpton has also called for Americans to "tune-out" the live telecast, the most watched non-sports TV event of the year.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Eva Williams-Bly, a 60-year-old who attended another black church where Sharpton spoke, said she was disappointed the Oscars are not as diverse as they should be.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>But, she noted, "I've got too many other things to worry about," naming homelessness, affordable housing, racial profiling by police and voting participation. </p><span id="midArticle_11"/><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>BEST PICTURE TOSS-UP    </p><span id="midArticle_13"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Going into Sunday's ceremony, there was no consensus on which of the eight best picture nominees will take home the top prize.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>"All the tea leaves are pointing in a different direction. It could be 'The Revenant', 'Spotlight,' 'The Big Short' or even 'Mad Max: Fury Road'," said Tom O'Neil, founder of awards website Goldderby.com.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>With a leading 12 nominations, a Golden Globe and a BAFTA, 20th Century Fox's "The Revenant" with its ambitious  tale shot in sub-zero temperatures has the epic qualities that traditionally appeal to the 6,200 voters of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>If "The Revenant," directed by Mexican Alejandro Inarritu, wins best picture, it would mark the first time in Academy Awards history that a filmmaker directed two best picture winners in a row. Inarritu's "Birdman" won the 2015 best picture Oscar.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Open Road Films' "Spotlight", which traces the journalism probe of sex abuse in the Boston Catholic Church, is also in the mix, along with Paramount's Wall Street misdeeds comedy "The Big Short," pundits say. </p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Warner Bros well-reviewed "Mad Max: Fury Road" has  10 nominations and could turn out to be a rare action-adventure best picture winner.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Among the sure bets, popular Leonardo DiCaprio is seen as certain to win his first ever Oscar for his role as an 1820s fur trapper bent on revenge in "The Revenant."</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Rising star Brie Larson, 26, is the heavy favorite to take home the best actress Oscar for her compelling depiction of an abducted young woman in indie movie "Room."</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>And 40 years after the first "Rocky" movie, Sylvester Stallone, 69, appears to have the sentimental edge over "Bridge of Spies" actor Mark Rylance in the supporting actor race thanks to Stallone's role as a boxing trainer in "Creed."</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Oscar producers are hoping for fewer "thank yous" from the winners this year. In a bid to speed up the 3-1/2 hour ceremony and encourage more interesting acceptance speeches, a scrolling list will run on screens of the agents, managers, director and friends that each winner wishes to acknowledge.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><span id="midArticle_8"/><p> (Additional reporting by Daina Beth Solomon; Editing by Mary Milliken and Cynthia Osterman)</p><span id="midArticle_9"/></div>
