<br><div id="start-of-content"><article class="content link-underline relative body-copy" data-js="content" itemprop="articleBody" readability="38.742056074766"><p>After a whirlwind week in which Radiohead wiped their social media channels and released two new songs—<a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/05/new-radiohead-song-video-creep/" target="_blank">“Burn the Witch”</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTAU7lLDZYU" target="_blank">“Daydreaming”</a>—today the band finally released their long-awaited ninth album, <em>A Moon Shaped Pool</em>. But now that the album is finally here, a new question has arisen: How can we listen to it? </p>
<p>The album is currently available for purchase from <a href="http://www.amoonshapedpool.com/" target="_blank">online here</a>. It’s also available for purchase <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/a-moon-shaped-pool/id1111577743" target="_blank">from iTunes</a>, and available to stream <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/a-moon-shaped-pool/id1111577743" target="_blank">via Apple Music</a>. <a href="http://www.amoonshapedpool.com/" target="_blank">Radiohead’s website</a> is also offering pre-orders for a CD version of the album that will ship on June 17 and a special edition vinyl/digital/etc. release that will ship in September. </p>
<p>Beyond <em>A Moon Shaped Pool’</em>s release, those looking for a throwback (read: non-streaming and pre-<em>A Moon Shaped Pool</em>) Radiohead experience will soon get their wish, too. XL Recordings, which previously released the band’s <em>In Rainbows</em> and <em>The King of Limbs</em>, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/65306-radiohead-discography-getting-vinyl-reissue/" target="_blank">will be putting out</a> the band’s entire back catalog on vinyl on May 20. </p>
