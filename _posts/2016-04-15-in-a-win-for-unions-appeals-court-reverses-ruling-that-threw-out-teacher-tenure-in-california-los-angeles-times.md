                          <p>In a major victory for unions, a California appeals court reversed a<a href="http://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/documents/B258589.PDF"> lower court ruling that </a>threw out tenure and other job protections for the state's public school teachers.</p><p>The case was being closely watched across the country because advocates argued allowing administrators to more easily fire bad teachers would improve schools and student performance. Right now, there are a series of job protections that are evoked before school districts can remove a teacher.</p>
  <p>“I think it’s a win certainly for educators, but also a win for students,” California Teachers Assn. President Eric C. Heins said of Thursday's ruling. “The trial never made the connection between the harms they were alleging and the statutes they were challenging. I think the laws have been working.”</p><p>A judge’s <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-teacher-lawsuit-20140611-story.html">2014 ruling</a> in the case, Vergara vs. California, held that several key job protections for teachers are so harmful to students that they deprive children of their constitutional right to an education.</p><span class="trb_ar_cont" data-ar-cont="Article continues below"/>
    <p>Lawyers representing the state of California and its powerful teachers unions <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/education/la-me-0225-vergara-teacher-tenure-arguments-story.html">argued</a> earlier this year before the three-judge panel that the decision should be reversed and that the laws in question do not violate students’ rights.</p><p><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/newsletters/la-newsletter-essential-california-signup-page-htmlstory.html">NEWSLETTER: Get essential California headlines delivered daily &gt;&gt;</a> </strong></p><p>At issue was the ruling by L.A. County Superior Court Judge Rolf Treu, which nullified the state’s system of awarding strong protections for teachers — including tenure, which takes effect at the end of their second year on the job.</p><aside class="trb_embed" data-content-id="84109884" data-content-size="small" data-content-type="story" data-content-slug="la-most-read-stories-this-hour" data-content-subtype="story" data-role="socialshare_item  imgsize_ratiosizecontainer " data-state=""/><p>Treu’s decision would have ended tenure as well as the practice of “last-in, first-out,” which typically results in districts laying off less-experienced teachers during budget cuts — regardless of how well they do in their job.</p><p>And Treu also threw out rules that provide teachers a longer and more complex system to challenge dismissals.</p><p>Backers of the lawsuit argued that making it easier for schools to get rid of bad teachers would help schools.</p><p>Treu concluded the state's tenure and seniority systems harmed all students, but especially poor and minority students, leading to outcomes that "shocked the conscience."</p><p>Had the ruling been upheld, teachers at unionized schools would no longer be entitled to a level of job security that's rare, even in the public sector.</p><p>Opponents, including Gov. <a title="Jerry Brown" href="http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics-government/jerry-brown-PEPLT007547-topic.html">Jerry Brown</a> and the state's teachers unions, characterize this solution as simplistic and even dangerous.</p><p>They say that killing tenure and seniority would result in a lower-quality teaching corps, and that the profession would attract and retain fewer of the sort of talented people who have other career options.</p><p>The plaintiffs said they plan to appeal the ruling. Lead counsel Theodore Boutrous called the ruling a “temporary setback” in a statement, adding that the Court of Appeals “mistakenly” blames school districts. “The mountain of evidence we put on at trial proved … that the irrational, arbitrary, and abominable laws at issue in this case shackle school districts and impose severe and irreparable harm on students,” Boutrous said.</p><p>But the ruling’s strong and direct language would make it difficult for the plaintiffs to win an appeal with the California Supreme Court, an expert said. The ruling repeats that the plaintiffs did not offer enough evidence to show that teacher tenure statutes are themselves unconstitutional, said Stuart Biegel, a UCLA education and law professor.</p><p>------------</p><p><b>For the Record</b></p><p><b>5:02 p.m.:</b> An earlier version of this post incorrectly said the court ruled that the plaintiffs did not have enough evidence to show teacher tenure statutes are not in themselves unconstitutional. It has been corrected.</p><p>------------</p><p>“This shows that it’s not going to be so easy to win such a case in a court of law” in other states, Biegel said. "But it doesn’t necessarily show that teacher tenure is alive and well and shouldn’t be reformed.”</p><p>“The court found that it was administrative decisions that caused the harm that plaintiffs had been discussing,” rather than the statutes themselves, Biegel said.</p><p>Vergara has caused small ripple effects across the country.
