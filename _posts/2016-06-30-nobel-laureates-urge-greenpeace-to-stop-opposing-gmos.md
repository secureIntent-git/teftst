"The basic method does not lead necessarily to a bad thing."</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>

It said other efforts to address nutrition needs in developing areas of the world should be funded and implemented.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>"We've been attacked in countries around the world because we're working with farmers and communities on the threat they face from GMOs,‚Äù said Charlie Cray, a senior researcher with Greenpeace. "The real issue here is: Why are they doing a press conference in Washington D.C. a week before there is a major vote in GMO labeling?" </p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>The U.S. Senate is scheduled to take a procedural vote next week on a bill that could pre-empt Vermont's GMO labeling law, set to take effect on July 1.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>The laureates say science backs them up and urged Greenpeace to re-examine which findings the group uses in its advocacy.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>"They are willing to dismiss the views of the vast majority of scientists," said Randy Schekman, who won a Nobel in physiology or medicine in 2013. "What I fail to understand is their acceptance of science and the scientific process when it serves their purposes, but in their opposition, they oppose the view of scientists."</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><p> (Reporting by Adam DeRose; Editing by Dan Grebler)</p><span id="midArticle_14"/></div>
