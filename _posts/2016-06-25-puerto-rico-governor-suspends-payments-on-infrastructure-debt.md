<span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">NEW YORK</span> Puerto Rican Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla late on Friday declared a suspension of any payments on some debt issued by the U.S. territory's infrastructure financing authority, citing the authority granted under a local emergency debt moratorium law.</p></span><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>Garcia Padilla signed an executive order that applies to "certain Puerto Rico Financing Authority (PRIFA) notes," a statement from the government said.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>"With this action, all obligations to transfer revenues or funds related to the PRIFA BANs (bond anticipation notes) are suspended," the statement said.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Garcia Padilla said in the statement that the PRIFA notes were now covered obligations "pursuant to the Puerto Rico Emergency Moratorium and Rehabilitation Act," which the Puerto Rican legislature passed in April.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>That act grants the governor the authority to declare a moratorium on any debt payment he deems necessary. However, creditors have filed lawsuits in the U.S. courts, calling the measure illegal as Puerto Rico, and its debt, is subject to U.S. statutes rather than local law.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
