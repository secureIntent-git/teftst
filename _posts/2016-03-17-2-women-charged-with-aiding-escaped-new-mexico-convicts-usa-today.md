That's when, police said, Abeyta invited Clah into her apartment.</p><p>Clah told Abeyta he had escaped from prison, officials said, but Abeyta said she enjoyed his "companionship"—at least until she called the cops on him two days later.</p><p>Petrushkin, who was arrested later Wednesday night, conspired with one of the convicts before their escape, according to the statement. Petrushkin admitted she spoke with Cruz while he was detained at the Penitentiary of New Mexico, offering to help if he got away.</p><div id="module-position-O4uzCNAan3I" class="story-asset image-asset" readability="33"><aside itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="wide single-photo" readability="6"><img itemprop="url" src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1458196633_708_2-women-charged-with-aiding-escaped-New-Mexico-convicts-USA-TODAY.jpg" alt="In this Saturday, March 12, 2016, photo provided by" width="540" height="405" data-mycapture-src="" data-mycapture-sm-src=""/><meta itemprop="name" content="AP PRISONERS ESCAPE A USA NM"/><meta itemprop="height" content="405"/><meta itemprop="width" content="540"/><p>In this Saturday, March 12, 2016, photo provided by the New Mexico Corrections Department shows inmate Joseph Cruz.<meta itemprop="copyrightHolder" content="AP"/> <span class="credit">(Photo: AP)</span></p></aside></div><p>The night Cruz and Clah escaped, Petrushkin was staying at the Hawthorne Suites in Albuquerque. She told police she received two phone calls from Cruz between 8:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. He asked where she was, and she told him.</p><p>Cruz and Clah arrived at Petrushkin's motel room around 2 a.m.</p><p>Petrushkin harbored Cruz and Clah in her hotel room, according to the statement. She gave them money and a cellphone, along with clothing for Clah.</p><p>"Ms. Petrushkin was aware both Cruz and Clah were fugitives at the time and chose not to contact law enforcement, opting instead to aid and abet the fugitives," New Mexico State Police said in the statement.</p><p>Clah was serving a 30-year prison sentence for his 2009 conviction in the shooting of Sgt. Korey Faulk of the San Juan County Sheriff's Office during a high-speed chase. Cruz has been convicted of first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder and child abuse in the slaying of a Raton man in 2006. He was serving a life sentence.</p><p>Investigators said they believe the men picked their handcuffs, but it’s still not known how they broke free from their leg irons, ditched their white prison jumpsuits and changed clothes and got a ride headed north to Albuquerque, a roughly three-hour drive. The two made it to the Albuquerque hotel by 2:30 a.m.</p><p>Authorities didn't realize the men were missing until about four hours after the escape. Two unidentified guards were placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation into the escape, state corrections officials said.</p><p><em>Contributing: The Associated Press </em></p><!-- cxenseparse_end --><p>Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1pvyko7</p></div>
