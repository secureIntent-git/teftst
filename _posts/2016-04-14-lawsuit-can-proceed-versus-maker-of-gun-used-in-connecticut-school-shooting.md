<span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocatio&lt;/span&gt;n">A lawsuit can proceed against the maker of the gun used in the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School that left 20 children and 6 adults dead, a Connecticut judge ruled on Thursday. </span></p></span><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>Bushmaster, manufacturer of the AR-15 assault weapon used in the attack in Newtown, Connecticut, had asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit, saying it was protected by a 2005 federal law blocking lawsuits against gunmakers when their products were used in the commission of crimes. </p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The lawsuit was filed in 2014 by the families of nine of the people who were killed.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Superior Court Judge Barbara Bellis declined to dismiss it, saying the gunmaker, a unit of Madison, North Carolina-based Freedom Group Inc, had not proven that the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act stopped her from hearing the case.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"The Superior Court has subject matter jurisdiction over a wrongful death action where the injury arose out of conduct by the defendants," Bellis wrote. "Any immunity that PLCAA may provide does not implicate this court's subject matter jurisdiction."</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The lawsuit seeks unspecified financial damages. It argues that the legally purchased AR-15 used by Adam Lanza in the attack should never have been sold because it had no reasonable civilian purpose.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Attorney Josh Koskoff, representing the families, welcomed the judge's decision and said in a statement, "The families look forward to continuing their fight in court."</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>An attorney for Bushmaster could not be reached for comment.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Lanza, 20, ended his attack by turning his gun on himself. Before going to the school, he fatally shot his mother, Nancy, who had bought the gun.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>After the shooting, Connecticut's Democratic governor, Dannel Malloy, pushed through one of the strictest gun laws in the United States, banning more than 100 types of military-style rifles and limiting ammunition magazines to 10 bullets.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>"We've passed the toughest gun laws in the nation for a reason," Malloy said in a statement. "These families deserve this, the ruling is the right one. The gun industry should not have protections that no other industry in America sees."</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Modified versions of the AR-15 are legal in Connecticut.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><span id="midArticle_12"/><p> (Reporting by Scott Malone in Boston; Editing by Toni Reinhold)</p><span id="midArticle_13"/></div>
