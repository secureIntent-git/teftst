		<p>Tropical Storm Colin picked up speed and closed in on the Florida coast Monday afternoon while pouring down rain on a large area of the Southeast.</p>

<p>As of 4 p.m. CDT, <a href="http://www.ssd.noaa.gov/PS/TROP/floaters/03L/03L_floater.html">Tropical Storm Colin</a> was located about 70 miles south-southwest of Apalachicola, Fla.</p>
<p>Colin had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph. Its winds have been unchanged all day, and the National Hurricane Center didn't expect it to strengthen much, if at all, before it makes landfall.</p>
<p>Colin picked up speed Monday afternoon as expected and was moving north-northeast at 23 mph, the hurricane center said.</p>
<p>On that path Colin could make landfall in Florida's Big Bend region by this evening.</p>
<p>It was then expected to move across portions of Florida and southeastern Georgia early Tuesday morning and head up the southeastern coast of the United States later on Tuesday. It could transition to a post-tropical storm during that time.</p>
<p>The hurricane center cautioned, however, not to focus solely on the point of landfall. </p>
<p>Colin was a lopsided system and its worst effects were being felt well to the east of the circulation center.</p>

<p>Tropical storm force winds extended up to 230 miles from the center of the storm.</p>
<p>Rain and storms were already flooding areas on the Florida peninsula, and rain was falling on the panhandle and into southern Alabama and Georgia on Monday afternoon. </p>
<p>Florida was covered in warnings. A tropical storm warning was in effect for the Gulf Coast from Indian Pass to Englewood.</p>
<p>A second tropical storm warning was also in effect on the Atlantic coast from Sebastian Inlet in Florida to the South Santee River in South Carolina. It was extended northward Monday afternoon to Oregon Inlet in North Carolina.</p>
<p>Colin was still a relatively weak tropical storm, and the hurricane center didn't expect to strengthen much if at all before it makes landfall. However, some slow strengthening may be possible on Tuesday when the storm re-emerges over the Atlantic. It was not expected to become a hurricane, however.</p>
<p>Colin's main impact could be flooding rainfall.</p>

<p>The hurricane center said 3-5 inches of rain is possible in northern Florida, southeastern Georgia and along the coast in the Carolinas through Tuesday. Some areas could get up to 8 inches.</p>
<p>Some storm surge will also be possible if Colin's arrival coincides with high tide on the Gulf Coast. One to 3 feet of surge could be possible from indian Pass to Tampa Bay, and 1-2 feet possible from Tampa southward to Florida Bay, the hurricane center said.</p>
<p>Coastal flooding and dangerous surf will also be a risk along the Gulf Coast as well as the east coast of Florida and Georgia.</p>
<p>A few tornadoes will also be possible for areas in Colin's path, and several warnings had been issued in Florida on Monday afternoon.</p>

<p>Colin still hadn't gotten its act together as a tropical storm, however.</p>
<p>The storm was encountering wind shear and that will likely keep it from intensifying before landfall, the hurricane center said.</p>
<p>It also didn't resemble a tropical storm, with most of its heaviest storms and strongest winds well to the east of the center.</p>
<p>In fact, the hurricane center said that a reconnaissance aircraft found Colin's strongest winds about 200 nautical miles southeast of the center of circulation on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>Alabama was not in the forecast cone, but the National Weather Service in Mobile warned that Colin will stir up seas and create a high risk of rip currents along beaches in the state as well as northwest Florida.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/wwamap/wwatxtget.php?cwa=mob&amp;wwa=high%20surf%20advisory">high surf advisory</a> was in effect until 7 a.m. Tuesday for coastal Baldwin County in Alabama and Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Florida. <a href="http://forecast.weather.gov/wwamap/wwatxtget.php?cwa=mob&amp;wwa=rip%20current%20statement">Rip currents</a> were also possible in coastal areas of Mobile County, the weather service said.</p>
<p>Colin is the third named storm of 2016 in the Atlantic. The season runs through Nov. 30.</p>
