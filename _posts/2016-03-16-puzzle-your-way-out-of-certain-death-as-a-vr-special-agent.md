<br><div id=""><p><em>I Expect You To Die</em> is a virtual reality puzzle game tour de force.</p>
<p>The game is inspired by Goldfinger’s immortal verbal riposte to 007, “No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die,” and puts you in the kind of potentially deadly, if thoroughly cartoonish, situations James might find himself in. Locked in a booby-trapped automobile inside the cargo hold of an airplane that’s about to crash, f’rinstance. To survive, you must observe your environment and manipulate the objects at hand to find your way out.</p>
<p>Strewn about are tools that you can use in a variety of ways, but also instructions and other nudging hints that guide you to solutions. I spent a little time with the game at the Oculus event at the Game Developer’s Conference, and I like its no-nonsense attitude towards the puzzles: This is not a hand-holdy experience, and you <em>will</em> fall victim to the traps before you escape.</p>
<p>You have the power of telekinesis, because why not, and because it allows developer Schell Games to leave you in a seated, stationary position while also letting you access everything in the room. So inside that car, you might need to find a screwdriver to unscrew a panel on the dashboard, but said screwdriver is outside of the car.</p>
<p>You roll down the window, letting poisonous gas waft into the car. Grab the screwdriver using mind power (which merely involves using the analog stick on the Oculus Touch controller) and roll the window up before the gas fills the car. You’ve probably screwed this up, so now you’re dead. That isn’t so bad, because the biggest challenge of the game is figuring out what to do, not actually doing it. A minute or so later, you’ll have rushed through the puzzle bits you’ve already spent half an hour figuring out, and be right back at the beginning.</p>
<p>The car thing, which is available as a demo if you have an Oculus dev kit, is fairly easy to get through. The second level shown here at GDC is much tougher—you’re at the evil villain’s desk, trying to find, then destroy, his latest death-dealing contraption. This mission requires a great deal of observation and thought—there’s a safe with a secret code that’s not immediately obvious, many sheets of paper that explain how to work the machines you find, and a whole heck of a lot of stuff strewn about that might be red herrings or might be incredibly important.</p>
<p>Death is a temporary setback, inattention is the real killer. Expect to spend a lot of time in the Oculus as you poke your way through these brainteasers. I had a blast with the demo; as a certified IRL escape-room nut I can’t wait to get shot, blown up, gassed, and otherwise murdered over and over once <em>I Expect You To Die</em> is ready to roll.</p>
