Hours before Obama arrived, officials in Orlando said that nearly two dozen people injured in the shooting were still hospitalized, six of them in critical condition.</p> <p>Another three were in “guarded” condition, while the rest were stable, according to Orlando Regional Medical Center, where many of the victims were taken. The hospital said its surgeons had performed 50 operations in the four days since the shooting, with more scheduled for Thursday.</p> <p channel="wp.com" class="interstitial-link"> <i> [<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/06/15/sen-toomey-and-bloomberg-discussing-gun-control-measure-to-close-the-terror-gap/?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_pp-senategun-325am:homepage/story">Senate Democrats end marathon filibuster; leaders negotiating votes on gun control measures</a>] </i> </p> <p>“This healing process is not going to happen overnight,” Schultz told reporters on Air Force One. “It’s not going to be a quick one.

Corrine Brown (D) — while another, Sen. Bill Nelson (D), flew down with Vice President Biden, officials said. When Obama arrived in Orlando, he shook hands with Gov.

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee.</p> <p>In a letter sent Wednesday to Facebook, Johnson wrote that Mateen had previously used the social network to search for information about the Islamic State’s leader and the San Bernardino, Calif., terror attack. After the shooting, though, he searched for news about “Pulse Orlando” and “Shooting,” Johnson wrote.</p> <p>Authorities are sorting through a hornet’s nest of possible motivations and explanations, sifting through the gunman’s pledges of loyalty to the Islamic State, his prior claims about other militant groups, the possibility that anti-gay sentiment motivated his attack and the added fact that witnesses say they had previously seen him on gay dating apps and at the club.</p> <p channel="wp.com" class="interstitial-link"> <i> [<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/06/14/terror-watch-lists-at-center-of-congressional-debate-post-orlando-shooting/">After Orlando shooting, senators target terror watch lists</a>] </i> </p> <p>New details continue to emerge about what he said and did after the shooting. While Johnson’s letter to Facebook did not explicitly say when the shooter posted about the Islamic State, he said these postings occurred on Sunday. The shooting took place at about 2 a.m. on Sunday, and after a three-hour hostage standoff with police, the gunman was killed in a shootout with officers.</p> <p>In a grim echo of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/12/04/san-bernardino-attackers-tried-to-cover-their-tracks-official-says/?utm_term=.2621a2f6660b" target="_blank">the attacks in San Bernardino</a>, the gunman used Facebook the day of the shooting to pledge loyalty to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the emir of the self-proclaimed Islamic State.</p> <p>“America and Russia stop bombing the Islamic state..I pledge my alliance to abu bakr al Baghdadi..may Allah accept me,” Mateen posted, according to Johnson.</p> <p>He then posted “The real muslims will never accept the filthy ways of the west” and “You kill innocent women and children by doing us airstrikes..now taste the Islamic state vengeance.” In a final post, Mateen apparently wrote, “In the next few days you will see attacks from the Islamic state in the usa.”</p> <p channel="wp.com" class="interstitial-link"> <i> [<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/investigation-into-orlando-shooting-continues-no-impending-charges-expected/2016/06/15/c3eccf5e-3333-11e6-8758-d58e76e11b12_story.html">Orlando shooter posted messages on Facebook pledging allegiance to the leader of ISIS and vowing more attacks</a>] </i> </p> <p>“America and Russia stop bombing the Islamic state..I pledge my alliance to [Islamic State leader] abu bakr al Baghdadi … may Allah accept me,” Omar Mateen wrote, according to the letter, which requested Facebook’s assistance in the investigation.</p> <p>Mateen then posted, according to the letter: “The real muslims will never accept the filthy ways of the west” and “You kill innocent women and children by doing us airstrikes … now taste the Islamic state vengeance.”</p> <p>The social media postings corroborate accounts that Mateen was motivated in part by a perceived connection to the Islamic State. Mateen also pledged allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State during 911 calls, although he also apparently mentioned the Boston Marathon bombers.</p> <p>FBI Director James B. Comey said earlier this week that there were no signs that Mateen was directly tied to any kind of network, and he added that was still not clear exactly which extremist group he supported.</p> <p>Mateen’s references to terrorist groups have at times been muddled. Officials say he made comments in recent years to co-workers claiming he had family connections to ­al-Qaeda and was a member of Hezbollah, two opposing terrorist groups that have clashed repeatedly in Syria.</p> <p>Mateen also apparently used Facebook in May to look for information on the terrorists behind the 2015 San Bernardino attack. On June 4, 2016, a little more than a week before the shooting, he searched “Baghdadi Speech,” according to Johnson’s letter.</p> <p channel="wp.com" class="interstitial-link"> <i> [<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-says-he-was-right-about-obama-and-terrorists-citing-questionable-2012-intelligence-cable/2016/06/15/2bf2666c-330d-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html">Trump says he was ‘right’ about Obama and terrorists, citing questionable 2012 intelligence cable</a>] </i> </p> <p>Authorities seeking answers about the gunman say they  have expanded the investigation to include interviews with his relatives, friends and anyone else who may have had contact with him in the months before the attack.</p> <p>As investigators continue probing Mateen’s life, they are also scouring digital forensics and are trying to reconstruct his actions dating back months. Meanwhile, evidence technicians were methodically tracing the path of the barrage of bullets that flew inside Pulse as they attempted to diagram precisely what happened.</p> <p>Mateen appeared to be a very skilled shooter, according to documents released Wednesday, repeatedly scoring high marks on tests needed to obtain firearms licenses. According to records dating to last year, Mateen had smoked marijuana, used steroids and had been expelled from high school in the ninth grade for fighting.</p> <p channel="wp.com" class="interstitial-link"> <i> [<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-guilt-of-being-alive-is-heavy-survivor-of-nightclub-shooting-says/2016/06/14/ac366268-3251-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html">‘The guilt of being alive is heavy,’ survivor of nightclub shooting says</a>] </i> </p> <p>In these records, Mateen said he had been convicted of a crime, placed on probation and had a criminal conviction sealed or expunged. He did not specify the offense. He said he spoke excellent Farsi and good Arabic.</p> <p>Asked why he had never served in the U.S. military, Mateen said that he “wanted to stay close to family.”</p> <p>Reached by telephone Wednesday evening, Mateen’s mother, Shahla Mateen, said she knew nothing of her son’s plans.</p> <p>“No. Nothing. Nothing,” she said.</p> <p>Mateen said “we” — she didn’t specify who else — were out of town and got back late last week.</p> <p>“Friday I didn’t see him and just Saturday,” she said, before she stopped talking and hung up the phone.</p> <p>A man later answered Shahla Mateen’s phone. He did not identify himself.</p> <p>“We want to have our own life back again,” the man said. “We have a loss, and there are a lot of disasters and a lot of bad news and because of it and we don’t have a life.”</p> <p>While the FBI said it views the shooting as a hate crime as well as an act of terrorism, officials said there were “no impending charges” in the case and declined to discuss whether any were forthcoming.</p> <p>The FBI confirmed that it had interviewed Noor Z. Salman, Mateen’s wife. She urged her husband not to do anything the night of the attack, said one U.S. law enforcement official. But the bureau also tried to play down this element of the investigation, saying it was part of the larger work of piecing together the gunman’s movements and motivations.</p> <p>“With respect to the wife,” Ronald Hopper, an FBI assistant special agent in charge, said Wednesday, “that is only one of many interviews we’re doing.”</p> <p channel="wp.com" class="interstitial-link"> <i> [<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-had-closely-scrutinized-the-orlando-shooter-before-dropping-investigation/2016/06/13/838e9054-3177-11e6-8ff7-7b6c1998b7a0_story.html">FBI had closely scrutinized the Orlando shooter before dropping investigation</a>] </i> </p> <p>Salman has not publicly commented on the attack, and she has not been seen since Monday night, when the Miami-based television station WSVN recorded video of the 30-year-old being escorted from her home in Fort Pierce, Fla.  Her face was shrouded by the hood of her sweatshirt, and her left hand had what appeared to be a silver wedding band.</p> <p>She had accompanied Mateen at one point to buy ammunition and went with him on at least one trip to Pulse described as “reconnaissance” not long before the shooting, according to officials familiar with the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing probe. Whether she knew the purpose of that trip remains unclear.</p> <p>Investigators are still working to corroborate what Salman told them during interviews, according to authorities, and will also try to determine if she suffered any abuse at the gunman’s hands. His first wife — Sitora Yusifiy, to whom he was briefly married in 2009 — said he beat her repeatedly while they were married. How authorities ultimately view Salman’s role and actions could change if she was a victim of abuse or feared for her life, officials say.</p> <p>“We’re looking at everything,” Hopper said.</p> <p>He also said authorities had found no evidence yet that Mateen intended to target any other locations, and officials said they had no information about any possible surveillance at Disney or any knowledge of Mateen patronizing clubs besides Pulse.</p> <p>Mateen’s phone has been recovered, and forensic experts were about to access the data, an official said.</p> <p><em>Berman reported from Washington.
