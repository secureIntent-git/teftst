<br><div id="start-of-content"><p>You think <em>you’ve</em> got a hard time packing for a trip? Try being Newt Scamander, the exiled creature-courier at the heart of J.K. Rowling’s <em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find</em> <em>Them. </em>As evidenced by the film’s first full trailer—which you can watch above—Newt never travels without a suitcase that’s overstuffed with critters and overflowing with magic.</p>
<p>Based on J.K. Rowling’s 2001 novel of the same name, <em>Beasts—</em>the first film in a new Potter-borne trilogy—stars Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne (<em>The Theory of Everything</em>) as Newt, a Dumbledore-adored Hogwarts student who’s been booted out of the school for beastie-related reasons, and has found his way to early-20th century New York City, suitcase in hand. His arrival plunges him into a world of wizards and witches, and also puts him on the radar of Percival Graves (Colin Farrell), a wizard who’s trying to track him down, as well as Porpentina Goldstein (<em>Inherent Vice</em>‘s Katherine Waterston), a witch who helps him make his way through Manhattan. They’ll need to stick together: As the trailer proves, there’s all sorts of strange magic going on in the city—which may be why, at one point, we see Newt plop his suitcase on the floor, open it up, and step into it, beckoning his roommate, Jacob Kowalski, (Dan Fogler) to follow. We’ll see what they find when <em>Fantastic Beasts </em>opens November 18.</p>
<p><strong>Pause at 00:17</strong>: to see some creepy lil’ beast-fingers poke their way out of Newt’s suitcase.</p>
