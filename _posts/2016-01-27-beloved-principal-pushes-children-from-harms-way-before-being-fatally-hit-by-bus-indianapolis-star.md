The video opened with shots of elementary school students holding signs with words to describe Jordan: Friendly. Focused. Smart. Organized. Inspirational.</p><p>“She always brings a positive spirit to Amy Beverland,” said one teacher on the video who is unidentified by name. “One thing I know makes her a great leader is that she always trusts in her teachers, and she’s always positively supporting us.”</p><p>Later in the video, a group of students shouted an acrostic using Jordan’s name.</p><p>“A is for awesome, because you’re an awesome principal,” one student said.</p><p>The video closed with a message to Jordan: “We love you Mrs. Jordan! Amy Beverland really is the sunshine after the rainbow.
