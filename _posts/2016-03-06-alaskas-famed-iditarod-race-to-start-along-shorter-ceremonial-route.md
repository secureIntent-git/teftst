Each of the last four races has been won by either Seavey or his father, Mitch.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"I would assume most of my competitors are coming back with better teams than they brought in the past. I know I am."</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Saturday's events are known for drawing hordes of fans armed with cameras and banners who gather to cheer on the 85 mushers, a number of them from as far away as the United Kingdom and Sweden, as they ride through the streets of downtown Anchorage.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>A lack of snow in the state's largest city, however, forced race organizers to shorten the race's ceremonial start to three miles (4.8 km) from 11 miles (17.7 km), despite efforts to bring in fresh snow by train from Fairbanks, Hooley said.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Mushers will hit 21 checkpoints with distances between stops ranging from 18 to 85 miles (29 to 137 km) before reaching the finish line in the coastal community of Nome, after traveling some 975 miles (1,569 km). </p><span id="midArticle_8"/>

She grew up in Ohio and has completed races in Idaho, Wyoming, Russia, and Alaska. "For me, the (timed) re-start, it's just --get me out on the trail and let me be with my dogs."    </p><span id="midArticle_10"/><span id="midArticle_11"/><p> (Reporting by Steve Quinn in Jueanu, Alaska; Editing by Eric M.
