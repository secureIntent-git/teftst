Analysts were expecting earnings of 7 cents.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"Given all the challenges Yahoo has faced with the reduction of its workforce and the Alibaba spinoff plan, to come in and deliver these numbers is a very positive thing," JMP Securities analyst Ronald Josey said.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The company's shares rose nearly 1 percent to $36.66 in light volumes in extended trading on Tuesday.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Under pressure from activist investors, Yahoo launched the auction of its core business in February after shelving plans to spin off its stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (<span id="symbol_BABA.N_1">BABA.N</span>). It has also said it could spin off the business.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The first round of bids for interested parties closed on Monday, according to media reports. Verizon Communications Inc (<span id="symbol_VZ.N_2">VZ.N</span>) is reportedly the favorite to win the auction and YP Holdings LLC, formerly known as Yellowpages.com, is the latest firm to express interest.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Time Inc (<span id="symbol_TIME.N_3">TIME.N</span>), Alphabet Inc (<span id="symbol_GOOGL.O_4">GOOGL.O</span>), Comcast Corp (<span id="symbol_CMCSA.O_5">CMCSA.O</span>), AT&amp;T Inc [TATTC.UL] and IAC/Interactivecorp IAC.O stepped out of contention prior to Monday’s deadline to submit bids, according to a Dow Jones report.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>But if activist investor Starboard Value LP has its way, Yahoo's Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer and her entire management team will be pushed out in favor of a board of its choosing to conduct the sale process. Starboard, which owns 1.7 percent of Yahoo, announced last month it will push for a proxy fight during Yahoo’s annual meeting, expected to take place in June.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>

        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>"It looks like they're doing the same thing for the second quarter, setting themselves up for hopefully another beat. You could argue that they're maybe being a little conservative," he said.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>In her nearly four years as Yahoo's CEO, Mayer has made little progress in her attempts to win back market share from bigger internet players such Facebook Inc (<span id="symbol_FB.O_7">FB.O</span>) and Alphabet Inc's (<span id="symbol_GOOGL.O_8">GOOGL.O</span>) Google.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Mayer's attempts to gain market share included the $1.1 billion acquisition of social blogging site Tumblr and the MAVENS strategy - a shift toward promoting mobile, video, native and social networking advertising products.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>The Internet company's revenue peaked in 2008 and while it still runs some of the world's most-read websites, it has been unable to keep up with Google and Facebook in the battle for online advertisers.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><span id="midArticle_1"/><p> (Reporting by Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Bernard Orr)</p><span id="midArticle_2"/></div>
