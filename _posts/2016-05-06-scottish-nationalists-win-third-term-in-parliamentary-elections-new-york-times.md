The Conservatives captured 31 seats, and Labour had 24.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="307" data-total-count="1084">Labour did find success elsewhere, including victories in some important municipalities in England and in two parliamentary by-elections, as well as in the contest for the Welsh Assembly. The overall performance was probably enough to stabilize the position of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/05/world/europe/labour-party-british-elections.html">the party’s left-wing leader, Jeremy Corbyn</a>.</p><div id="story-ad-1" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

The results in that contest will not be declared until Friday evening.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="294" data-total-count="1617">Mr. Corbyn, who was elected overwhelmingly last year as Labour leader by party members and supporters, is at odds with many of his lawmakers, most of whom did not vote for him, and he found himself dealing with another crisis last week after revelations <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/29/world/europe/labour-party-suspends-ken-livingstone-hitler-remarks.html">about anti-Semitism</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/28/world/europe/britain-labour-party-leader-suspends-lawmaker-over-anti-israel-posts.html">in the Labour ranks</a>.</p><figure id="media-100000004388929" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000004388929 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/07/world/07Britain-web2/07Britain-web2-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group"><span class="visually-hidden">Photo</span>

That helped Labour retain control of municipalities in areas such as Crawley, Southampton, Norwich and Hastings, where the party had been thought vulnerable.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="346" data-total-count="2277">According to the BBC analysis, Labour’s share of the vote declined about 6 percent on average compared with 2012, the last time this set of English seats was contested. The party’s losses were limited, however, because of a 4 percent increase in crucial areas when compared with its unsuccessful performance in the general election last year.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="255" data-total-count="2532">Labour retained its seats in two by-elections to the British Parliament, for the constituencies of Sheffield Brightside and Ogmore, and Joe Anderson of the Labour Party won a second term as mayor of Liverpool, one of several cities electing civic leaders.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="218" data-total-count="2750">In Wales, Labour was on course to remain the biggest party in the Welsh Assembly, where the U.K. Independence Party, which has taken a firm stance against immigration and European Union membership, won its first seats.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="174" data-total-count="2924">Mr. Corbyn’s troubles have taken away the focus from the Conservatives, who are deeply divided over a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/world/europe/britain-european-union-brexit.html">June 23 referendum</a> on whether Britain should leave the European Union.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="199" data-total-count="3123">Given that Mr. Cameron’s government has recently faced a crisis over the steel industry and industrial action by junior doctors, the party’s performance will most likely be enough to satisfy him.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="260" data-total-count="3383">Mr. Cameron’s party staged a recovery in the elections to the Scottish Parliament, where it had won 16 seats to Labour’s 11 as of Friday morning, emphasizing the collapse of support for Mr. Corbyn’s party among Scots, who used to vote solidly for Labour.</p><a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#whats-next">Continue reading the main story</a>
