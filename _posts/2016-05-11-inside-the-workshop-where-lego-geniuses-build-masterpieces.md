The workspace is the base of operations for Legoland California, and the birthplace of thousands of Lego creations found throughout the park. Here, certified <a href="http://www.wired.com/tag/lego-master-builder" target="_blank">Lego Master Builders</a> like Robbie McCarthy and Bill Gowdy work in teams to assemble models from tens of thousands of individual bricks. It’s a magical, if potentially overwhelming, place; the space houses more than 3-million bricks, organized in colorful bins that line the Model Shop’s tall, expansive shelves.</p>
<p>To help organize the assembly process, Master Builders rely on Lego’s proprietary 3-D modeling software that lets them build, manipulate, and scrutinize intricate constructions brick-by-brick, or layer-by-layer. It’s a remarkably powerful tool—one we wouldn’t mind taking for a spin, ourselves. You can sneak a peak at the Model Shop, and Lego’s modeling tool, in the video up top.</p>
