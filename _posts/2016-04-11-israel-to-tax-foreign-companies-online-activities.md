        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Until now, a foreign company's income from providing services in Israel was only subject to tax if it was generated in Israel. A company would be liable for tax only if its activity rendered it a "permanent establishment."</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>But the Israeli authorities have widened the definition of permanent to include online businesses, where the economic activity of the foreign company is mainly through the Internet.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>A spokesman for Google in Israel declined to comment. Ebay, Facebook and Amazon were not immediately available for comment.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>There has been pressure building for some time for foreign companies operating in Israel to pay more tax. The issue has been raised in parliament that foreign firms do not pay the same tax rates as Israeli ones, creating a business environment that favors international companies. Last week, a blimp with "Google must pay tax" written across it floated over the Tel Aviv skyline and near Google's offices.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>The tax authority is also seeking to implement a law in which digital services - such as downloading music or books - from a foreign online store would also be subject to VAT.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><span id="midArticle_9"/><p> (Reporting by Steven Scheer.
