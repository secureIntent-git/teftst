<p>The State Fire Marshal Peter J.

Everything that was on display went up.”</p><!-- total:0 -->

<p>Julia Nittler, 24, was staying at her family’s beach house across the bay when she said she heard a blast. </p><p>“It was really loud. The whole ground shook when it happened,” she said. </p><p>Rish Shadra, 18, of Hopkinton, said he thought the show was going as planned but had an unusually over-the-top ending.</p><p>“The fireworks were going off pretty normally, then there was a decently sized blast and what looked like a finale. A few minutes later, the barge was on fire,” Shadra said. “The fire boats got it out pretty fast though.”</p><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-version="7" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);" readability="-11.822834645669"/> <!----><i>Travis Andersen of the Globe staff and Globe correspondent Alexandra Koktsidis contributed to this report.
