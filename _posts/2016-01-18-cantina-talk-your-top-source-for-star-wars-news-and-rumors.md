<br><div id=""><p>There’s been an awakening. Not in the Force, per se—although surely a Supreme Leader or two will disagree about that—but in the Star Wars chatter hitting our feeds since <em>The Force Awakens</em> opened.</p>
<p>You might have expected the rumors to slow down following the release of J.J. Abrams’ film, but no. Not in the slightest. Rumors, and theories about the next generation of star warriors abound, as does speculation about future installments in everyone’s favorite space opera. There’s so much buzz that it’s impossible to keep up with it all. That’s why we’re here. Our mission here at Cantina Talk (working title, though it might stick) is to bring you all the juicy bits we can find. Appreciate these highlights, friends, many Bothans spent some time on the Internet to bring you this information.</p>
<h3>Are Finn And Poe Destined to Be a Couple?</h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> The hopes and dreams of the assembled fandom.<br/><strong>Probability of Accuracy:</strong> Highly Unlikely<br/><strong>The Real Deal:</strong> If one thing lodged in the collective unconscious of audiences, it is that Rey’s <em>awesome</em>.

<p>Whoa, not so fast. Journalist Chris Mandle shared something from a future John Boyega interview on Twitter guaranteed to break some hearts:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" readability="8.1717791411043">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Sad news: John Boyega confirmed to me the Finn/Poe romance is not canon and it only exists “in Oscar’s head” <img src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Cantina-Talk-Your-Top-Source-for-Star-Wars-News-and-Rumors.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"/></p>

<p>All isn’t lost, of course, and, let’s face it, <a href="http://panels.net/2016/01/13/art-roundup-finnpoe-star-wars-force-awakens/">the idea led to some great fan art</a>. But even if Finn and Poe don’t become a couple, it doesn’t mean either of them are necessarily straight, especially given how excited Isaac seems to be about the idea. If nothing else, it’d be worth it just to mess with <a href="http://terribleminds.com/ramble/2015/09/07/star-wars-aftermath-reviews-news-and-such/">the bigots</a> who had a problem with <em>Star Wars: Aftermath’</em>s Sinjir Rath Velus.</p>
<h3>Supreme Leader Snoke Is Darth Vader</h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Twitter, The Internet<br/><strong>Probability of Accuracy:</strong> Laughingly Absurd<br/><strong>The Real Deal:</strong> Comics store owner Ryan Higgins launched a Star Destroyer fleet’s worth of speculation last week when he tweeted these images side-by-side:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" readability="4.0481927710843">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">gtfo <a href="https://t.co/bZMWN7Ym11">pic.twitter.com/bZMWN7Ym11</a></p>
<p>— Ryan Higgins (@RyanHigginsRyan) <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanHigginsRyan/status/684923666992238592">January 7, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
<p><br/>He immediately followed that with <a href="https://twitter.com/RyanHigginsRyan/status/684924113748533248">a second tweet</a> saying, “I’ll file this under ‘purposefully similar to the originals to invoke the feels’ instead of ‘character hidden in plain sight.'” <a href="http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Snoke-Darth-Vader-Star-Wars-Picture-Make-You-Do-Double-Take-104497.html">The</a> <a href="http://movieweb.com/star-wars-force-awakens-snoke-darth-vader/">Internet</a> <a href="http://www.newsarama.com/27430-snoke-vader-a-crazy-star-wars-theory.html">was</a> <a href="http://www.inquisitr.com/2691083/is-supreme-leader-snoke-really-darth-vader-spoilers/">less</a> <a href="http://www.theweek.co.uk/star-wars/57322/star-wars-7-is-rey-turning-to-the-dark-side-and-three-other-big-questions">guarded</a>, and appeared to consider the similarities proof of a connection between Lord Vader and Supreme Leader Snoke. (For those who haven’t seen the film, or Higgins’ tweet, the similarity isn’t that they’re both bald; it’s the scar atop their heads that’s seen as the damning evidence.) While it’s not impossible that there is <em>some</em> connection between the two characters—indeed, that’s almost guaranteed considering Snoke’s control over the Vader-worshipping Kylo Ren—the possibility that Snoke actually <em>is</em> a somehow resurrected Vader seems more than a little slight. We’re siding with Higgins on this one.</p>
<h3>Young Han Solo Will Appear in <em>Rogue One</em></h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Industry rumors<br/><strong>Probability of Accuracy:</strong> Probable<br/><strong>The Real Deal:</strong> A <a href="http://variety.com/2016/film/news/star-wars-han-solo-spinoff-actors-1201675519/">report in <em>Variety</em></a> didn’t just list some of the actors on the shortlist to play everyone’s favorite space smuggler in the Lawrence Kasdan-written <em>Han Solo</em> prequel project, it also contained this surprising little nugget: “While insiders were unable to confirm, the new Solo could have a small cameo in <em>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</em> before appearing in his own standalone pic.” This is somewhat surprising given that the official synopsis for <em>Rogue One</em> suggests that it takes place immediately prior to <em>A New Hope</em> (it is, after all, about the stealing of the Death Star plans that leads to the raid that opens the latter movie), which would make a 20-year-old Han too young to be involved. For now, we’ll file this under, “Well, if you say so…”</p>
<h3>Rey’s Parentage Will Remain a Mystery Until <em>Episode IX</em></h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Speculation following filmmaker comments<br/><strong>Probability of Accuracy:</strong> Unclear, Try Again Later<br/><strong>The Real Deal:</strong> A recent interview with <em>Episode IX</em> director Colin Trevorrow definitely gave the impression that while the identity of Rey’s parents isn’t a mystery to those working on the Star Wars movies (J.J. Abrams <a href="http://www.ew.com/article/2016/01/12/star-wars-jj-abrams-rey-parentage-kenobi-skywalker">is also amongst those in the know</a>, apparently), the audience <a href="http://www.etonline.com/news/179765_colin_trevorrow_promises_satisfying_answer_to_star_wars_theories/">won’t find out until 2019</a>. “We’re going to make sure that that answer is deeply and profoundly satisfying,” he told <em>Entertainment Tonight</em>. “We’ll make sure that that answer is something that feels like it was something that happened a long time ago, far away, and we’re just telling you what happened.” Putting aside the notion that Star Wars should be reportage instead of a gleefully pulpy adventure movie, it’s not obvious whether or not Trevorrow is using “we” in his response to talk about everyone working on all the Star Wars movies, or just those working with him on <em>Episode IX</em>. If it’s the latter, then the obvious question to ask is: Why aren’t we going to find out in <em>Episode VIII</em>? (And if we’re not going to find out then, does that mean Luke <em>isn’t</em> her father?)</p>
<h3><em>Episode VIII</em> Will Be the Dark <em>Empire Strikes Back</em>-Like Episode</h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Speculation following actor comments<br/><strong>Probability of Accuracy:</strong> Probable<br/><strong>The Real Deal:</strong> During an <a href="http://www.vogue.co.uk/arts-and-lifestyle/2016/01/john-boyega-interview-star-wars-finn-actor">interview with British <em>Vogue</em></a> John Boyega expressed relief that he no longer had to keep secrets about <em>The Force Awakens</em>, but then reveled he’s back to keeping mum now that work has begun on 2017’s <em>Episode VIII</em>. His only comment on the screenplay? “It’s great. Much darker, but we’re very excited.” Well, of <em>course</em> it’s darker; that’s what Star Wars trilogies do with their middle installments—and given how much <em>The Force Awakens</em> “homaged” the original <em>Star Wars</em>, it’s absolutely no surprise that its follow up would go a similar route to 1980’s <em>Empire Strikes Back</em>. Given that that movie is regarded by many (if not most) fans as the best Star Wars feature to date, let’s take a moment to consider the pressure on director Rian Johnson to deliver with his chapter.</p>
<p>…OK, moment’s over. <em>Don’t screw it up, Johnson</em>.</p>
