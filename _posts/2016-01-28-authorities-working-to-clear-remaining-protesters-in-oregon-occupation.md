<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">BURNS, Ore.</span> Law enforcement officials worked on Thursday to convince remaining protesters in a month-long armed occupation of a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon to leave the site following the shooting death of a member and calls from the group's leader to stand down.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The FBI and local law enforcement have set up checkpoints near the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in northeast Oregon and are working "around the clock to empty the refuge of the armed occupiers in the safest way possible," a statement said.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Eight more people had left the compound by late on Wednesday, the FBI said, and three were arrested and facing charges of felony conspiracy to impede federal officers.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>It was unclear how many people remained inside the refuge but in a video posted on YouTube overnight, Oregon activist David Fry said he was among five protesters still there.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The jailed leader of the protest, Ammon Bundy, urged supporters still occupying the site on Wednesday to head home.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>"To those remaining at the refuge, I love you. Let us take this fight from here. Please stand down ... Please go home," Bundy said in a statement read by his attorney following a court hearing. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Bundy and at least a dozen armed individuals holed up at the refuge on Jan. 2 in a flare-up in the so-called Sagebrush Rebellion, a decades-old conflict over federal control of millions of acres in the West.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Law enforcement had kept an eye on the protest from afar until Tuesday, when Bundy and members of his group were stopped en route to a speaking event by the FBI and Oregon State Police. Shots were fired during the incident and a member of Bundy's group was killed, authorities said.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>He was identified by activists as Robert LaVoy Finicum, a rancher who acted as a spokesman for the occupiers. Bundy's brother, Ryan, was wounded. Several members were arrested, including the Bundy brothers.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>The protesters were each charged with conspiracy to use force and intimidation or threats to impede federal officers from discharging their duties.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Citing the investigation, authorities declined to say what led to the fatal shooting but urged the protest members to leave the refuge peacefully.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>In the YouTube video, Fry said some activists fled so quickly after Bundy's arrest that they left their guns. </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>"Right now, the situation is that they're willing to let, out of five people left here, four of us are allowed to leave, and one of them ... he has a felony warrant," Fry said. </p><span id="midArticle_13"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Fry said his group will not leave the refuge unless authorities drop the charges against the man accused of obstructing a federal worker from doing his job.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Jason Patrick, who remained at the refuge following Bundy's arrest, told Reuters by phone some protesters were leaving through checkpoints but he rejected the word "surrender."</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>Patrick was among the three arrested late Wednesday, according to the FBI.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>Reactions to the takeover from residents in Burns, about 30 miles (48 km) from the refuge, have included sympathy for two imprisoned local ranchers whose plight began the protest, to dismay at the armed occupation by individuals seen as outsiders.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><span id="midArticle_2"/><p> (Reporting by Victoria Cavaliere in Los Angeles and Gina Cherelus in New York; Editing by <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=gareth.jones&amp;">Gareth Jones</a> and <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=bill.trott&amp;">Bill Trott</a>)</p><span id="midArticle_3"/></div>
