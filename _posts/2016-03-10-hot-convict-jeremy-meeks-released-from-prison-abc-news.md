<p itemprop="articleBody">
"Hot convict" Jeremy Meeks is a free man.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
The convicted felon was released from prison on Tuesday, his agent confirmed to ABC News. Meeks became an Internet sensation in 2014 when his mug shot went viral after the Stockton Police Department in California posted it on its Facebook page. He was sentenced to 27 months in prison last year on weapon charges, but had hoped for an early release for good behavior.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Now, Meeks is looking forward to a career in modeling and acting.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
"We have a lot in store regarding Jeremyâ€™s new career," Meek's agent, Jim Jordan, said in a statement today. "There are a multitude of offers on the table. Jeremy is humbled and grateful and overwhelmed by the outpouring of love, support, and prayers for him and his family.
</p>



<p itemprop="articleBody">
Meeks will be spending the next few weeks in transitional housing "before he is completely free to start his new journey," Jordan said.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
In an <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/business/technology/instagram.htm" id="ramplink_Instagram_" target="_blank">Instagram</a> post today, Meeks thanked his family and fans for their support while he was in prison, adding that he's "ready" for what lies ahead.
</p>

<p itemprop="articleBody">
Last year, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/hot-convict-jeremy-meeks-plans-modeling-future-prison/story?id=29270589">Meeks told ABC News</a> in an interview from prison that he was working on getting ripped in preparation for his modeling career.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
"I eat healthy. I do a lot of push-ups, pull-ups, dips, burpees, and I stay very active," he said.</p>
