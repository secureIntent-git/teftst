<br><div id=""><p>Turning apps into money has always seemed like a fairly straightforward proposition. Sell the app, get the money. Or better yet, give the app away, and sell upgrades inside it. But while the basics remain largely the same, the alchemy that goes into it has changed significantly. How you buy apps, and where, and what kind, is going to change a lot in the next few years. It’s already started.</p>
<p>A new report from app analytics firm App Annie lays bare just how far the app landscape’s tectonic plates have shifted. As you might expect from such a complex, interwoven ecosystem, a host of factors come into play. The geography has changed. The business models have evolved. Even the devices are different. That means challenges for some developers, opportunities for others, and a world of choice for consumers.</p>
<h3>Subscription Salvation</h3>
<p>Let’s make one thing clear: In-app purchases, the insidious upgrades and add-ons that crowd your credit card statement, aren’t going anywhere. Neither are in-app ads. “Advertising and in-app purchases are the two dominant methods of generating revenue,” says Eric Thompson, data analyst for App Annie.</p>
<p>And why would they? The top revenue earners in 2015 were all either in-app upgrade monsters, like <em>Clash of Clans</em>, <em>Game of War</em>, and (yes, still) <em>Candy Crush Saga</em>. The blanket category of in-app purchases, though, was also buffeted by the continuing rise of recurring charges to services like Spotify and HBO Now. “Subscription revenue made incredible gains,” says the App Annie report, “thanks to strong demand for video, music, and dating apps.”</p>
<p>Subscriptions are worth highlighting for a few reasons. First, they’re recurring, and predictable; there’s no sense of exasperation trying to get to the next level. More interesting still is that 2015 was the year subscriptions finally broke out of their streaming video and music niche, thanks largely to <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/03/tinder-is-capitalist/" target="_blank">Tinder’s introduction of a controversial paid tier</a>. Despite a March introduction of Tinder Plus, Tinder still ranked in the top five apps in worldwide, combined iOS and Google Play revenue.</p>
<p>Other dating apps have found similar success, though on a smaller scale, both at home and abroad. The more important for the app economy, though, may be whether other app types can shift to a subscription model as well. The short answer? Don’t get your hopes up.</p>
<p>“I think that there are inherent limitations to the subscription model,” says IDC mobile analyst John Jackson. “They will tend to continue to coalesce around a relatively narrow set of services.” Jackson adds that there’s plenty of opportunity for break-out hits within those niches, but the idea that someone would subscribe to, say, a calendar app month after month seems far-fetched.</p>
<p>Or games, for that matter. Speaking of which, what about games?</p>
<h3>Pay to Play</h3>
<p>That there are more mobile games than ever is obvious. That the mobile games that find the most success are coming from increasingly diverse sources is less so, and makes for a far more exciting app future.</p>
<p>“Although the individual apps leading the revenue charts remained relatively steady in 2015, beneath the surface there have been massive shifts in the mobile gaming market,” according to the App Annie report. “Games are maturing at a faster rate, while mobile gaming revenue has become less concentrated.”</p>
<p>One reason for the broader publisher opportunities? People move on from mobile games more quickly than ever. App Annie estimates that the time for maturity for new games—how long it takes between release and dropping off the face of the earth—dropped 60 percent from 2014 to 2015, from nearly 50 weeks to just over 17 weeks. That’s not a lot of time to make noise. Or, conversely, it’s a lot more opportunities for noise to be made.</p>
<p>“On the one hand, smaller publishers have taken up a greater slice of the market,” says App Annie. “On the other, the prospect of long-term success with just one or two games continued to become less realistic for most publishers.”</p>
<p>While it’s harder than ever to find breakout success, short attention spans mean both that smaller publishers have a decent shot of at least getting noticed. It also means that customers may finally be wising up to the “premium” part of “freemium,” and more open to alternatives.</p>
<p>“I think freemium apps and games will always make the most money, but I do see premium making a comeback,” says Ryan Cash, co-founder of Snowman, the studio responsible for iOS hit <em>Alto’s Adventure</em>. “For a while, everyone was sort of blind to the whole freemium thing, and just saw the ‘free’ part of the word. But now, I think people understand that a ‘free’ download doesn’t actually mean that a product isn’t going to cost you money.”</p>
<p>Cash sees the potential for a resurgence in up-front payments for premium apps, a trend that got a recent assist when Apple introduced a “Pay Once &amp; Play” section of the App Store. “Most people still won’t pay for apps or games, but you don’t need that,” says Cash. “You just need decent little audience, and you can be profitable.”</p>
<p>In a fun twist, resurgence in the old way of doing things may find its best hope for success in a new guard of devices.</p>
<h3>Whole New Worlds</h3>
<p>It’s too early to say what sort of impact the new Apple TV will have on apps, if it has much of one at all. At the very least, it already has quantity; as of November, there were just over 1,000 tvOS apps available to download, according to app tracker <a href="http://www.slidetoplay.com/apple-tv-apps-top-list/" target="_blank">Slide to Play</a>.</p>
<p>For now, the top-grossing Apple TV apps follow familiar trends, a mix of subscription media like HBO Now and Hulu, and freemium games like Asphalt 8. Still, it’s early days, and there’s no reason to expect that it will fall into the same patterns.</p>
<p>“For Apple TV, it’s pre-history,” says Jackson. “We don’t know how valid a precedent mobile is going to be for TV.” Already, some higher-priced pay-once apps are sitting high on the games charts. As apps mature while developers get accustomed to the platform, and more users show up to provide data points, expect to see even more experimentation.</p>
<p>The same can be said for the Internet of Things, an arena for apps that has yet to be filled beyond the earliest adopters. To say nothing of the Apple Watch, which only recently allowed native apps, and still hasn’t seen many developers take advantage.</p>
<p>Equally important shifts on the software side are changing the types of apps that get made. As smartphones become more feature-filled, more standalone apps become redundant. Developers, meanwhile, have begun to focus less on apps themselves than on features existing powerhouse apps might find useful. What one was an app might now be just a feature.</p>
<p>“It’s gone from a situation where startups say they have a service that they’re going to put into an app, and put into the App Store, to one where they have something they want to expose, and instead of putting it in an app and hoping for the best, they’re going to try to sell it to OpenTable or Uber or whoever,” says Jackson. “If I have a payment technology, or micro-location technology, or take your pick, instead of appifying it, I’m going to try and sell it or distribute it to the universe of third parties that might want this functionality.”</p>
<p>Further changes will be driven by geography. App Annie notes that China now accounts for more iOS downloads than the US, while the Play Store saw enormous growth in emerging mobile markets like India, Indonesia, and Turkey. The apps that get made will increasingly target international customers, while payment monetization systems will need to evolve to accommodate them as well; Jackson points to Facebook’s recent misadventures in offering <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-criticized-in-india-over-free-limited-internet-1453398493" target="_blank">free data in India</a> as an early example of that evolution.</p>
<p>For developers, while the initial gold rush has long subsided, that doesn’t mean the app economy is dead. It just means it’s all grown up.</p>
<p>“The reality is, it’s just like any business,” says Snowman’s Cash. “Most businesses fail. Most movies never make it into hollywood. Most musicians aren’t making Kanye money. If everyone on your street opened up a lemonade stand, they wouldn’t all succeed. The same goes for the app industry. Is it harder nowadays? Certainly. But is it impossible? I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>And for consumers? The good news is that nothing is settled. If you like freemium, you’ve got plenty of options. Subscriptions? They’re there too. Pay upfront? You got it. And then, of course, there’s whatever’s coming next.</p>
