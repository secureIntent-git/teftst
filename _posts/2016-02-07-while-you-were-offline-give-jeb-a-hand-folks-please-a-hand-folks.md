<br><div id=""><p>What sort of a week has it been? Well, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2016/02/05/cleavagegate-susan-sarandon-fires-back-piers-morgan/79868214/">Susan Sarandon and Piers Morgan are at war over cleavage</a>, <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/users/2016/02/bernie_bros_are_bad_the_conversation_around_them_is_worse.single.html">people continue to argue over whether or not Bernie Bros exist</a> and, if so, are they really a bad thing, and <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-super-bowl-ads-20160204-story.html">America is still pretending</a> Super Bowl ads are actually a thing in an era where no really cares about commercials anymore. But, of course, that’s not all! Here are the highlights of what you might have missed over the last seven days of online activity.</p>
<h3>The Twitter Candidate</h3>
<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> DeRay McKesson announced his intention to become the mayor of Baltimore, and people got excited.</p>
<p><strong>Where It Blew Up:</strong> Twitter, blogs, media think pieces</p>
<p><strong>What <em>Really</em> Happened:</strong> Having risen to prominence as one of the leaders of Black Lives Matter—and, in a distinction seemingly important to some, one of the few people Beyoncé follows on Twitter—DeRay McKesson made news late Wednesday by <a href="https://medium.com/@deray/i-am-running-for-mayor-of-baltimore-34b4e214d582#.ij2xcgjz4">announcing</a> that he was standing for mayor of Baltimore in a Medium post.</p>
<p>“I am running to be the 50th Mayor of Baltimore in order to usher our city into an era where the government is accountable to its people and is aggressively innovative in how it identifies and solves its problems,” he wrote in a piece that acknowledged that while he was a “non-traditional candidate,” he is “a son of Baltimore.” He continued, “We can build a Baltimore where more and more people want to live and work, and where everyone can thrive.”</p>
<p>It was an announcement that tore through Twitter, McKesson’s traditional online stomping grounds.</p>

<p><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> Not everyone was convinced by McKesson’s candidacy, <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/2016-mayor-race/bs-md-ci-deray-mckesson-20160204-story.html">as the <em>Baltimore Sun</em> pointed out</a>, citing his lack of political experience and infrastructure—not to mention the <em>13 other candidates</em>—as potential stumbling blocks, but if the current presidential race has proven anything, it’s that lack of experience and a massive Twitter following can inspire passion from a great number of voters. It’ll be interesting to see how this goes. </p>
<h3>Asked and Answered</h3>
<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> A British newspaper wanted to know who would stand up for Britain (well, <em>England</em>, but we’ll get to that soon enough) in an impressively xenophobic concern-trolling editorial. The Internet responded.</p>
<p><strong>Where It Blew Up:</strong> Twitter, media think pieces</p>
<p><strong>What <em>Really</em> Happened:</strong> It was a front page headline—and, indeed, an op-ed as a whole—designed to grab everyone’s attention. Last week, European Union president Donald Tusk <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/02/02-letter-tusk-proposal-new-settlement-uk/">wrote a letter</a> to the EU council outlining the terms under which it was willing to negotiate the United Kingdom’s EU membership ahead of the UK’s upcoming referendum on whether or not it stays in the union. Responding to that letter, rightwing British newspaper the <em>Daily Mail</em> gave over its front page to the question “Who <em>Will</em> Speak For England?”</p>
<p>It’s a breathtaking piece (“voters deserve better than this,” it says at one point, decrying that instead they’re being offered “a one-sided, stage-managed charade of scaremongering, spin… and censorship”), with the arguable highlight coming midway through when it offhandedly states, “of course, by ‘England’, like Amery in 1939, we mean the whole of the United Kingdom.” But “Who <em>Will</em> Speak For the UK?” isn’t quite as likely to appeal to Eurosceptic bigots, is it?</p>
<p>Of course, once the question was asked, Twitter users took it upon themselves to answer:</p>

<p>Well, there you go. England—sorry, the whole of the United Kingdom—has got quite a few people willing to step up to the mic. Hopefully the <em>Daily Mail</em> is feeling a little bit better about things knowing that.</p>

<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Kanye West is on the cover of <em>Rolling Stone</em> … except, according to <em>Rolling Stone</em>, he’s not.</p>
<p><strong>Where It Blew Up:</strong> Twitter, media think pieces</p>

<p><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> So, really: why the trolling? Perhaps it was <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/will-waves-be-kanye-wests-first-disappointing-album-20160202">in response to this <em>RS</em> piece</a>, which dared to suggest that <em>Waves</em> will be West’s first disappointing album. Or perhaps Kanye is just bored? (The mustard thing, however, I can’t help you with.) Might we suggest a fake WIRED cover next, please?</p>
<h3>Brand New, You’re Retro</h3>
<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Amazon is planning to open 400 physical stores across the US. Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Where It Blew Up:</strong> Blogs, media think pieces</p>
<p><strong>What <em>Really</em> Happened:</strong> Hey, remember when Amazon put all the brick-and-mortar bookstores out of business? (Note: Obviously it didn’t. That was for dramatic effect, stay with me.) Well, this week, a loose-lipped mall CEO <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-plans-hundreds-of-brick-and-mortar-bookstores-mall-ceo-says-1454449475">revealed Amazon’s next step towards world domination</a>: brick-and-mortar bookstores!</p>
<p>Sandeep Mathrani, the CEO of mall operator General Growth Properties told an earnings call this week that the online giant was apparently planning to open 400 stores across America as part of a new expansion—something that, unsurprisingly, <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3056266/fast-feed/amazon-to-open-hundreds-of-brick-and-mortar-bookstores">got</a> <a href="http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-amazon-bookstores-20160202-htmlstory.html">a</a> <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/02/amazon-plans-hundreds-of-physical-bookstores-dj-citing-mall-ceo.html">lot</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/03/technology/amazon-is-said-to-be-planning-an-expansion-into-retail-bookstores.html">of</a> <a href="http://gizmodo.com/amazon-will-open-over-300-physical-bookstores-because-l-1756692355">people</a> <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/02/03/465443099/is-amazon-planning-hundreds-of-bookstores-analysts-doubt-it">talking</a>.</p>
<p>With Amazon refusing to comment on the rumors, things got stranger when <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-bookstore-idUSKCN0VC2N3">the original source walked back his comments</a> a day later, saying that they were “not intended” to represent any specific Amazon plans. Thing is, by that point, <a href="http://recode.net/2016/02/03/meet-the-guy-behind-amazons-secret-retail-store-plans/">Re/Code had done some digging</a> and found out more about the plans, which officially didn’t exist, but if they did would include multiple stores (not just bookstores) that would merge the best of Amazon with the best of in-person shopping, somehow. If they were created, that is. Which there are no plans to do, of course.</p>
<p><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> It’s unclear whether this counts as smart counter-intuitiveness, in-person nostalgia, or merely contrarian nonsense. Either way, we look forward to the inevitable announcement of the next smartphone technology, the “land line.” </p>
<h3>Jeb? Jeb! Meh.</h3>
<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Things aren’t going well in the Jeb! Bush campaign. </p>
