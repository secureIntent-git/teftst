<span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">MUMBAI</span> Blackstone Group LP (<span id="symbol_BX.N_0">BX.N</span>) is nearing a deal to acquire Hewlett Packard Enterprise's (HPE) (<span id="symbol_HPE.N_1">HPE.N</span>) controlling stake worth about $940 million in Indian IT outsourcing services provider MphasiS Ltd (<span id="symbol_MBFL.NS_2">MBFL.NS</span>), according to three sources directly involved in the deal.</p></span><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>HPE owns roughly 60.5 percent stake in MphasiS, and the U.S.-based parent had been looking to exit from the Indian venture to shore up its capital.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Bids for buying the MphasiS stake were submitted earlier this month and the U.S. private equity firm has emerged as the front-runner for taking majority ownership of the mid-sized Indian IT services exporter, the sources said.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Financial details of the possible deal were not immediately known. Based on MphasiS' stock price on Thursday, the HPE stake in the Bengaluru-headquartered company is valued at about $940 million. The company's total market value is about $1.6 billion.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Blackstone and HPE declined to comment, while MphasiS did not respond to emails seeking comment.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>MphasiS, whose rivals include outsourcers Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (<span id="symbol_TCS.NS_3">TCS.NS</span>) and Infosys Ltd (<span id="symbol_INFY.NS_4">INFY.NS</span>), is not likely to command a very high valuation as a major part of its business depends on subcontracting by HPE, one of the sources said.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Until a few years ago, MphasiS generated roughly half of its revenue by providing services to HPE's clients. This has now come down to 24 percent of the firm's total revenue, it said in its latest annual report.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The MphasiS deal, if closed, will be one of the biggest M&amp;A transactions in India's $150 billion outsourcing sector, and underscores foreign investors' confidence in growth potential as western clients send more jobs to India to cut costs.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Last month, Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte [GIC.UL] and PE investors Advent International and Bain Capital jointly bought a minority stake in India-focussed outsourcing firm QuEST Global Services for $350 million.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>MphasiS was formed in 2000 and six years later Electronics Data Systems Corp acquired a majority holding in the company. In 2008, EDS was acquired by Hewlett Packard, which resulted in the transfer of the shareholding to the computer maker.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>A pact on the deal could be signed by early next month, two of the sources said, cautioning the acquisition terms had not yet been finalised.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
