But other Iraqi security officials say the attack targeted an open-air market. The two differing accounts could not be immediately reconciled.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="100" data-total-count="530">The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the press.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="439" data-total-count="969">Thousands of Shiite pilgrims from across Iraq are expected to travel on foot to the shrine of 8th-century Imam Moussa al-Kadhim over the coming days to commemorate the anniversary of his death. While there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, the Islamic State group has claimed similar attacks targeting Shiite pilgrims and civilians in Baghdad's Shiite neighborhoods.
