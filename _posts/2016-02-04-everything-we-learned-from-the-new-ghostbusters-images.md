<br><div id="start-of-content"><p>This is all starting to feel like trolling, right? Despite the fact that director Paul Feig has been <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/07/paul-feig-wants-you-to-see-the-new-ecto-1/" target="_blank">very</a> <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/07/ghostbusters-proton-pack/" target="_blank">generous</a> in sharing information on social media about his forthcoming all-female <em>Ghostbusters</em> movie, it’s still largely a mystery. We know who our busters-of-ghosts are—Kate McKinnon, Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones—but for a while now the synopsis on IMDB has seriously just been “the plot is unknown at this time.”</p>
<p>And so, we are left to wonder. Which is generally fine, since we love a good enigma. (No, no, Feig. We mean that. We’re not mad. Wouldn’t kill you to return a text every once in a while, though.) However, being in the dark for this long means that people have had no choice but to speculate wildly about what actually happens in <em>Ghostbusters</em>. After all, the Internet has made it such that every little nugget of information about every movie spreads mercilessly on social media. In lieu of those facts, people…well, they make shit up.</p>
<p>Today, though, we have a little more to go on.</p>
<p>Late last night—or early this morning, depending on your time zone—Feig posted a tweet announcing that the new Ghostbusters web site was “up and running.” While the new site isn’t exactly a treasure chest of new details (though it is a treasure chest of awkward testimonials from Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd) there are enough new images that we can start to make our own ridiculous predictions about what’s to come. Click through the gallery above for our micro-analysis (read: fiction) of all the new G-buster #content.</p>
