</figure><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="236" data-total-count="2598">Mr. Ryan’s immediate goals, his advisers say, are to advance his agenda and protect the Republican majority in the House. Many of those goals involve policy that is sharply different from Mr. Trump’s brand of hard-edged nationalism.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="271" data-total-count="2869">Mr. Ryan’s desire to overhaul the immigration system, rein in the nation’s entitlement programs, promote vigorous free trade and push other aspects of traditional conservatism have been as welcome to Republican voters this year as carpenter ants at a home inspection.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="123" data-total-count="2992">This has alarmed the speaker because it bodes poorly for his chances for advancing what he calls “reform conservatism.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="85" data-total-count="3077">Those close to Mr. Ryan say he tends to put his policy agenda ahead of party loyalty.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="207" data-total-count="3284">“People in politics tend to be in two categories,” said Peter Wehner, a director of the White House Office of Strategic Initiatives under President George W. Bush, who has known Mr. Ryan for two decades.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="331" data-total-count="3615" id="story-continues-4">“Some are drawn to politics because they like the games and mechanics, and their first priority is the party,” Mr. Wehner said. “Bob Dole fell into that category. Mitch McConnell is also that party guy. And Ryan is just more in that camp of ideas, and he thinks about the party mostly as a vehicle to advance conservatism.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="146" data-total-count="3761">Mr. Ryan’s associates say he has also been repulsed by Mr. Trump’s bombastic tone and proposals like his call for a ban on Muslim immigration.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="355" data-total-count="4116">But he is just as motivated by his concern for protecting his House majority, something that was not even in question until Mr. Trump became the presumptive nominee. Although many analysts say the majority is safe for now, some of the most endangered House Republicans come from districts where Mr. Trump could be particularly damaging to their prospects.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="251" data-total-count="4367">There is, for example, little upside to Mr. Trump for Republicans like Representative Robert Dold, who represents the moderate-leaning north shore Chicago suburbs, or Representative Carlos Curbelo, who has a heavily Hispanic district in South Florida.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="280" data-total-count="4647">No former House speaker since James K. Polk has gone on to win the presidency, but if Mr. Ryan started a campaign in four or eight years he would begin with a formidable network of donors built up during his time in the House and while he was Mitt Romney’s running mate in 2012.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="76" data-total-count="4723">Mr. Romney may be the biggest booster of a future Ryan White House campaign.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="241" data-total-count="4964">“I would love to see him run for president,” Mr. Romney said of Mr. Ryan at a private fund-raiser in Washington last week for an Israeli university. A recording of Mr. Romney’s remarks was shared with The New York Times by an attendee.</p> <figure id="electoral-map-trump-clinton" class="interactive promo  layout-large"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/05/04/upshot/electoral-map-trump-clinton.html" readability="1.5">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="157" data-total-count="5467" id="story-continues-5">“The building of the machine would be easy, it’s just a question of if he actually ever wants to do it,” Mr. Senor said. “I don’t think he will.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="148" data-total-count="5615">While Mr. Ryan is seen as an institutional Republican relative to Mr. Trump, he draws from a brain trust that exists in large part off Capitol Hill.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="201" data-total-count="5816">A protégé of Jack Kemp, the former Republican congressman from New York, Mr. Ryan is a “free markets and free people” conservative of the sort venerated by The Wall Street Journal editorial page.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="376" data-total-count="6192">His outside informal consulting group includes Mr. Wehner; George Weigel, a founding president of the conservative James Madison Foundation; Yuval Levin, a founding editor of National Affairs; and many from Kemp world. “Paul is very interested in Catholic social doctrine, which is something I have written about extensively, so we talk a lot about that,” Mr. Weigel said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="212" data-total-count="6404">But this year, at least, Republican primary voters demonstrated no appetite for Mr. Ryan’s style of aspirational conservatism, having rejected both Senator Marco Rubio and former Gov. Jeb Bush, both of Florida.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="455" data-total-count="6859">Still, what ultimately may push Mr. Ryan toward a presidential run of his own is rooted in the agonizing situation he is enduring right now: a recognition that his ambitions for remaking his party into something that reflects his vision will not be realized outside of the White House because his push for an overhaul of the nation’s tax, entitlement and poverty programs toward a more free market orientation may be stymied unless he becomes president.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="119" data-total-count="6978">“He has now seen the power of the bully pulpit,” said Bob Wood, a lobbyist and, like Mr. Ryan, native Wisconsinite.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="385" data-total-count="7363">While Mr. Ryan keeps his eyes on getting through 2016, many of his Republican colleagues are clearly looking to 2020. Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a Never Trump leader, is widely viewed as angling for a run, as is Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas; Mr. Cotton’s state is considering a bill that would make it easier for him to run for re-election and the White House at the same time.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="71" data-total-count="7434">But most eyes are currently on Mr. Ryan, his demurrals notwithstanding.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="220" data-total-count="7654">“He says he’s not,” Senator Burr said. “ I take everybody at their word.” Then he paused. “Some mornings, I feel like I’m the only one looking in the mirror that doesn’t see the next president up here.”</p><a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#whats-next">Continue reading the main story</a>
