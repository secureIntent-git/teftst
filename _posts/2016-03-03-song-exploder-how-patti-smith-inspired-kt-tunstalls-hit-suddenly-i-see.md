<br><div id="start-of-content"><article class="content link-underline relative body-copy" data-js="content" itemprop="articleBody" readability="33.996161228407"><p><em>On the </em>Song Exploder<em> podcast, host Hrishikesh Hirway talks to musicians who take apart their songs and, piece by piece, tell the stories of how they were made. Listen below.</em></p>
<p>Singer/songwriter <a href="http://kttunstall.com/" target="_blank">KT Tunstall</a> released her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_to_the_Telescope" target="_blank">debut album</a> in 2004. The song “Suddenly I See” from that record was a hit on the radio, and it’s been used in the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1787566/#soundtrack" target="_blank">soundtracks</a> of big <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5UcNqMHz4o" target="_blank">movies</a> and <a href="http://greysanatomy.wikia.com/wiki/Enough_is_Enough#Music" target="_blank">television shows</a>. But the song was originally written back before KT Tunstall had a record deal, when she was a struggling street musician, living in a small apartment in North London. In this episode, which was recorded live at the <a href="https://www.sundance.org/projects/song-exploder-live-with-kt-tunstall" target="_blank">Sundance Film Festival</a>, Tunstall breaks down how she made the song with help from producer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Osborne" target="_blank">Steve Osborne</a>. She also discusses how Patti Smith’s image on the cover of <em>Horses</em> influenced the song and how Osborne helped her figure out the perfect backing beat to turn her original demo into a radio-ready hit.</p>
