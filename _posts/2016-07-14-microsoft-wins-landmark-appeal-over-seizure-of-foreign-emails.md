"The focus of those provisions is protection of a user's privacy interests."</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Microsoft had been challenging a warrant seeking emails stored on a server in Dublin, Ireland, in a narcotics case.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>It was believed to be the first U.S. company to challenge a domestic search warrant seeking data held outside the country.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p><strong>AEROSPACE NEWS</strong>: <strong><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-airshow-britain-airbus-group-orders-idUSKCN0ZU17U?il=0">Airbus beats Boeing on orders tally at airshow</a></strong></p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Thursday's decision reversed a July 2014 ruling by then-Chief Judge Loretta Preska of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan requiring Microsoft to turn over the emails. It also voided a contempt finding against the company.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesman, said the agency was disappointed in the decision and was reviewing its legal options. Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>The case has attracted strong interest from the technology and media sectors, amid concern that giving prosecutors expansive power to collect data outside the country could make it harder for U.S. companies to compete there.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Dozens of companies, organizations and individuals filed briefs supporting Microsoft's appeal, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, CNN, Fox News Network, Gannett Co and Verizon Communications Inc.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Had the court gone the other way, "it would have been like the Wild West, with no clear, stable legal rules applying," Greg Nojeim, senior counsel with the nonprofit Center for Democracy &amp; Technology in Washington, D.C., said in an interview.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p> </p><span id="midArticle_15"/>

        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>But Judge Carney said limiting the reach of warrants serves "the interest of comity" that normally governs cross-border criminal investigations.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>She said that comity is also reflected in treaties between the United States and all European Union countries, including Ireland, to assist each other in such probes.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Some law enforcement officials have said obtaining such assistance can, nonetheless, be cumbersome and time-consuming.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Circuit Judge Gerard Lynch concurred in the judgment, and urged Congress to update the "badly outdated" 1986 law to strike a better balance between current law enforcement needs and users' privacy interests and expectations.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>He said the law as it stands lets Microsoft thwart an otherwise justified demand to turn over emails by the "simple expedient" of choosing to store them outside the United States.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>"I concur in the result, but without any illusion that the result should even be regarded as a rational policy outcome, let alone celebrated as a milestone in protecting privacy," he wrote.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>The case is In re: Warrant to Search a Certain E-Mail Account Controlled and Maintained by Microsoft Corp, 2ndU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-2985.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p> </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>(Reporting by Nate Raymond and Jonathan Stempel in New York, and Diane Bartz and Dustin Volz in Washington, D.C.; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)</p><span id="midArticle_13"/></div>
