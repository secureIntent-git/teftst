<span class="articleLocation">NEW YORK</span> Five men took turns raping a woman in a Brooklyn park after forcing her father at gunpoint to flee the scene, New York City police said.

&nbsp;

The 18-year-old woman was with her father in a park just after 9 p.m. on Thursday night when five men approached them, police said. One pointed a gun at the father and told him to leave.

After the father left, the men each assaulted the woman, police said. They fled when her father returned a short while later to the park, accompanied by two officers.

&nbsp;

The woman, whose name was not made public, was treated at a local hospital and released, police said.

Police released surveillance video taken in a nearby bodega that they said showed the five suspects prior to the attack. The video depicts a group of black men in jackets and sweatshirts talking and laughing inside the store.

&nbsp;

Police have asked for the public's help in identifying the suspects.
