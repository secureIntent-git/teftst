<br><div id=""><p>In these times post-<em>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</em> it’s easy to forget there’s still a lot of juice in the Superhero Movie Hype Machine this year. We still have <em>Captain America: Civil War</em>, <em>X-Men: Apocalypse</em>, <em>Doctor Strange</em>, and <em>Suicide Squad</em> coming—and that’s a <em>lot</em> of movies. If you’re not already excited by what’s to come, perhaps you’ve not been paying attention, which is <em>exactly</em> why we do this every week. Ladies! Gentlemen! Behold the highlights of the last seven days’ superhero movie news!</p>
<h3>SUPER IDEA: Well, He’s Not Called Eye Doctor Strange</h3>
<p>As <a href="https://twitter.com/scottderrickson/status/716758314168762368">filming wrapped for <em>Doctor Strange</em> this weekend</a>, those hanging around the New York set had a chance to <a href="http://madsmikkelsen.net/gallery/thumbnails.php?album=1074">see Mads Mikkelsen’s mysterious villain for themselves</a>, and… Well, we still have no idea who this is supposed to be. A pre-CGI Dormammu? A not-so-pale Nightmare? Dark magician Kaluu? Brand new character Scaleyeyes McBadguy? Any of those remain a possibility at this point, so your guess is as good as ours.<br/><strong>Why this is super:</strong> At least star Benedict Cumberbatch knew how to relax after shooting was done:</p>

<h3>SUPER IDEA: Superman v The Unexpected Possibility of <em>Man of Steel 2</em></h3>
<p>If you thought that the climactic battle of <em>Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice</em> meant that we wouldn’t be seeing any stand-alone Superman movies anytime soon, think again. While on the press tour supporting <em>BvS</em>, <a href="http://heroichollywood.com/solo-superman-movies-still-moving-forward/">director Zack Snyder said that</a>, “if we could get a good script it would be great to have a stand-alone Superman movie,” while the Man of Steel himself, Henry Cavill, added that it also depended on scheduling. “It depends on the sucess of this movie, if this goes well we can start negotiating with Warner Bros. for a standalone Superman but they have their plans laid out with other stuff, <em>Justice League</em> and other movies, it’s about finding the time really,” he said. “It is something that I would be very keen to do.” Look! Up in the sky! It’s a bird! It’s a plane! It’s a sequel that most of us thought wouldn’t happen!<br/><strong>Why this is super:</strong> In related news, look! It’s <a href="http://heroichollywood.com/new-wonder-woman-set-photos-amazonian-army/">lots of Amazons from <em>Wonder Woman</em>!</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BDmVU_IAh_Y/?taken-by=lexcorpindustries">Mysterious Instagram teases for future movies, maybe</a>! It’s surprisingly still all go for the DC Extended Universe, despite <a href="http://variety.com/2016/film/news/batman-v-superman-box-office-second-weekend-drop-1201744845/">that horrible second weekend box office</a>. </p>
<h3>SUPER IDEA: Spider-Man’s Web of Confusion</h3>
<p>Did a URL registration reveal the title of the next Spider-Man movie? <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/spider-mans-standalone-film-title-homecoming-may-have-been-revealed-teases-avengers-cameos-a6967656.html">That was the rumor earlier this week</a>, when eagle-eyed fans noticed that Sony had registered SpiderManHomecomingTheMovie.com, leading many to suspect that the movie would be titled <em>Spider-Man: Homecoming</em>. The next day, <a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/node/74840">it was reported</a> that Sony had also purchased SpiderManComingofAgeMovie.com, SpiderManGreatnessAwaitsMovie.com and SpiderManSuspendedMovie.com. (All four URLs redirect to the official Sony site.) Does that mean that Sony hasn’t decided on a name after all? Or maybe the studio registered three more domains in an attempt to distract from the accidental discovery of the title? Or is it something more confusing entirely?<br/><strong>Why this is super:</strong> Oh, the web we spin. While none of those prospective movie titles sound particularly appealing (especially <em>Spider-Man: Suspended</em>, which surely has to be a joke or misdirect), there is nonetheless something that <em>feels</em> right about using <em>Homecoming</em>, considering it’s Spidey’s return to the Marvel Universe. Also, maybe it means we’ll get to see Peter Parker head to a Homecoming Dance at some point, seeing as audiences loved seeing him cut a rug so much <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spiderman_3/">last time</a>. </p>
<h3>SUPER IDEA: Cap v Iron Man: Dawn of More Superheroes Fighting</h3>
<p>With <em>Captain America: Civil War</em> just weeks away at this point, it’s time for the promotional machine to start ramping up—which means, in practice, new <a href="http://collider.com/captain-america-civil-war-black-panther-new-image/">images</a> and clips showing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=The9xzfVabc" target="_blank">Black Panther in action</a>, <a href="http://screencrush.com/agents-of-shield-civil-war-spoilers-emancipation/" target="_blank">concern</a> that a plot synopsis for <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> spoils the ending of the movie, and Elizabeth Olsen <a href="http://www.etonline.com/news/185735_elizabeth_olsen_teases_scarlet_witch_and_vision_relationship_captain_america_civil_war_exclusive/">teasing</a> “some really sweet moments” between Scarlet Witch and the Vision this time around.<br/><strong>Why this is super:</strong> Look, if no one’s going to tease sweet moments between Cap and Tony as they try to repair their relationship, we’re just not interested, OK? (Sure, there <em>are</em> rumors suggesting reasons why that might not be possible, but if <em>BvS</em> can end with Batman admitting maybe Superman wasn’t so bad after all, then we live in hope!) </p>
<h3>SUPER IDEA: Short. Succinct. X-Men Tweets.</h3>
<p>Speaking of May-releasing movies requiring some promotion, this week we also got some new promotional images and a new teaser for <em>X-Men: Apocalypse</em> focusing on the main villain’s four flunkies…</p>

<p><strong>Why this is super:</strong> As nice as it is to get some focus on Storm, Psylocke, and Angel, let’s be real here: It’s a tragedy that whoever’s running the <em>Lego Batman Movie</em> Twitter account didn’t immediately release a parody poster with the caption “Darkness. Loneliness. No Parents.”</p>
