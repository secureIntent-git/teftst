<br><div id=""><p>LG just announced the prices on this year’s 4K HDR OLED televisions, and the cheapest one will set you back $4,000—a crazy amount of money, to be sure. But considering a plain old 1080p OLED TV cost $15,000 just three years ago, it’s an encouraging sign that very best TVs are slowly approaching affordability.</p>
<p>And make no mistake: 4K HDR OLED TVs might just be the very best televisions. A quick refresher on those acronyms helps explain why.</p>
<p>4K refers to the sets’ diamond-sharp screen resolutions, of course. <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/01/what-is-hdr-tv/ ">HDR (high dynamic range)</a> uses a wider color gamut—and usually brighter backlights—to create more lifelike images. It’s beautiful, but you need content encoded for it and a TV designed for it, both of which are currently in short supply. OLED stands for “organic light-emitting diode,” and it’s <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/09/battle-high-end-tv-tech-oleds-still-king/" target="_blank">widely considered the best display tech available</a>. That’s because it offers the finest pixel-by-pixel contrast and the deepest blacks you’ll see without visiting space. </p>
<p>All of which is to say a 4K HDR OLED TV will blow your mind, and charge you heavily for the privilege.</p>
<p>So when you decode that alphabet soup, LG’s prices seem sort of reasonable. Its sets are also versatile: All the models support both Dolby Vision and HDR10 formats, which is a rarity when it comes to playing HDR video, and an important assurance of future-proofing in case one format disappears. The entry-level OLED B6 line includes a 55-inch model for $4,000 and a 65-incher for $6,000. Want a curved screen? No sweat. Tell the dude at your local big-box store you want an OLED C6 model. They cost the same.</p>
<p>As nice as those models are, the step-up models are stunners. The E6 lineup has a slim “picture on glass” design that’s thinner than shaved deli meat. You’re looking at $5,000 for the 55-inch model and $7,000 for the 65-incher. They feature a built-in 40-watt 2.2 channel speaker along the bottom, which doubles as a stand. </p>
<p>The Signature OLED G6 flagship is the real head-turner and wallet-burner. At $8,000, the 65-inch G6 costs slightly less than that <a href="http://www.gulfstream.com/aircraft/gulfstream-g650">other kind of G6</a>, but it’s still expensive for a TV. It has a 60W 4.2-channel Harmon/Kardon soundbar stand you can tilt up and down. There’s also a 75-incher on the way, but pricing hasn’t been announced yet. It’ll be… a lot.</p>
<p>Which again, all of these are. But other than the G6, they’re only slightly more expensive than the top-tier LCD televisions. Samsung’s KS9500 4K HDR set costs $3,700 for the 65-incher. Sony’s 65-inch X930D is priced at $3,000. And Vizio, still the champion of bang-for-the-buck, has a 65-inch 4K HDR LCD panel priced at $2,000.</p>
<p>While OLED TVs produce inkwell blacks and beautiful contrast, those lower-priced LCD sets have an advantage when it comes to HDR. They use high-powered LED backlighting to boost the brightness and the color gamut of the picture. That means brighter fireballs, more-realistic spectral highlights, and more-nuanced gradations between colors. Until HDR content is mainstream, however, OLED will remain the display technology to beat.</p>
