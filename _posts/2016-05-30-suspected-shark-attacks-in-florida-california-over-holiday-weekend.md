"These are entirely predictable things just as you can predict drownings or car accidents as a result of this being a huge holiday weekend."</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Officials closed a 5-mile (8-km) stretch of beach in Newport Beach on Sunday but reopened a 2-mile (3-km) piece on Monday as lifeguard patrol boats and police helicopters searched for sharks, Halphide said. If any are is found, they will be observed but not caught or killed, he said.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>

Six were fatal worldwide, including one U.S. fatality in Hawaii. Of the U.S. attacks, 51 percent took place in Florida, according to the university's website.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>The increase, Burgess said, is due to shark populations slowly recovering from historic lows in the 1990s, the world's growing human population and rising temperatures that lead more people to go swimming.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><span id="midArticle_14"/><p> (Reporting by Barbara Goldberg in New York; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)</p><span id="midArticle_15"/></div>
