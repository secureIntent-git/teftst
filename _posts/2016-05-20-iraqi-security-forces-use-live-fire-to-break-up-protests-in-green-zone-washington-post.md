After protesters broke through — reaching the office of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi — security forces could be seen advancing across the bridges that lead out of the Green Zone, and firing tear gas, though it was not clear whether they were aiming at the crowd.</p> <p> Fadhil al-Ruwaili, a member of the health committee on Baghdad’s provincial council, said he didn’t have details on any deaths. Some of the protesters were injured with bullets and by inhaling tear gas, he said. Others were clubbed with batons.</p> <p> “They have opened fire on unarmed civilians, and this is against the constitution and against the law,” Ruwaili said.</p> <p> The protesters are largely supporters of Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who has ratcheted up political tension in the country by calling for a new technocratic government and urging his followers to the street. They managed to storm the Green Zone and ransack parliament late last month, but the incident was largely peaceful. However, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, fighting for political survival, had enacted new security measures in an attempt to not let them through again.</p><div class="inline-content inline-photo-left" style="width:300px;"> <a name="d99310e6a468af8b35f418f784ed42e103526109"/> <img alt="" src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1463768717_660_Iraqi-security-forces-use-live-fire-to-break-up-protests-in-Green-Zone-Washington-Post.jpg"/><span class="pb-caption">Anti-government protesters storm Baghdad's Green Zone.

Federal police forces who are more sympathetic towards the protesters had earlier let them cross.</p> <p> “We were holding roses and flags,” said Haider Hashm, 40, sitting on the curb and struggling to breath due to the effects of tear gas. “While we were giving them roses, they gave us tear gas and bullets.”</p> <p> Witnesses also said security forces fired live ammunition.</p> <p> In a statement, Sadr said that the government had used tear gas and live fire on “unarmed protesters.”</p> <p>“Be patient heroic Iraqi people, your peaceful revolution will end with victory,” he said.</p> <p> More than 250 were injured, according to Ali Mohsen al-Tamimi, the governor of Bagdad, who is with Sadr's party.

But he is no closer to meeting the demands of the street and has not managed to gather enough lawmakers for parliament to reconvene, necessary in order to legislate any changes.</p> <p> Meanwhile, anger is growing. Sadr City, a stronghold for Sadr’s supporters, was struck Wednesday by the second large market bombing by the Islamic State in a week, and many Iraqis blamed the government for failing to protect them.
