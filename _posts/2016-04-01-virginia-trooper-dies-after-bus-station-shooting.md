Greyhound said in a statement that no employees were injured.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Earlier local media reports that the trooper had died, that a second trooper had been injured and that as many as six people in total were injured in the attack were inaccurate, Geller said.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>She declined to answer questions as to what may have provoked the attack or to confirm earlier reports that the police had been conducting a training exercise around the bus station at the time. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The trooper who was shot was in uniform, Geller said.

"A co-worker was eating lunch in his car when he saw Greyhound Workers and customers rushing out the side door. He figured that was a good time to get back inside."    </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><p> (Additional reporting by Eric M.
