                <p><span class="dateline">ANTIGO, Wis. –  </span>Wisconsin police say a person toting a rifle opened fire outside a high school prom, leaving three people injured.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>Antigo Police Chief Eric Roller says in a statement that the shooter "showed up" Saturday night at Antigo High School and started firing at two people outside the building.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>Roller says officers in a nearby parking lot heard gunshots, and an officer fired upon the shooter, "stopping the threat." Roller says everyone at the prom was eventually "escorted from the school and are safe."</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>It was not immediately known if the unidentified suspect was among the injured at the hospital, or if they were a student. Roller says the shooter was in custody.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>The condition of those injured wasn't immediately known, but Roller says all three were taken to the hospital.</p>
