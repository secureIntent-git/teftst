If he does a good job ... that would be a terrific thing."</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Trump put forth the idea of the ban after deadly attacks by Islamist militants in Paris and California last year. Muslim and human rights groups, Trump's Democratic rivals and many of his Republican presidential opponents condemned the proposal as divisive, counterproductive and contrary to American values.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/>

        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>In an interview with Time magazine, Khan said he wanted to go to the United States to see the interesting programs the mayors of New York and Chicago were implementing, but that he would have to visit before January in case Trump won the Nov. 8 election.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>"If Donald Trump becomes the president I’ll be stopped from going there by virtue of my faith, which means I can't engage with American mayors and swap ideas," Khan said.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><span id="midArticle_8"/><p> (Reporting by Mohammad Zargham; Editing by Peter Cooney)</p><span id="midArticle_9"/></div>
