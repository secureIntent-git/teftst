Elon Musk’s <a href="http://wired.com/tag/tesla-motors">electric car company</a> announced this morning it will introduce a version of the sedan with a less powerful 60-kilowatt-hour battery pack, at a base price of $66,000. That makes it a bit cheaper than the previous cheapest version of the car, which started at $70,000. </p>
<p>The Model S is still very much a luxury car, and that new lower price is still double what Americans pay on average for a new vehicle. But it’s striking because it’s the first time Tesla has made one of its products cheaper. Since its 2012 introduction, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/04/tesla-keeps-making-model-s-better-better-pricier/">Tesla has steadily improved the sleek seven-seater</a>—and the price has gone up accordingly. It was introduced for under $60,000, but the base price had risen up to $70,000. (The top of the line model, the P90D, with all-wheel drive and a 90-kWh battery pack, starts at $109,500.) The sedan now comes with all-wheel drive (a $5,000 option on the new 60-kWh version), autopilot, and a slew of software improvements that make driving on electricity more practical. </p>

<p>The new Model S 60 will offer a range of more than 200 miles (you get close to 300 in the 90D), a 0 to 60 mph time of 5.5 seconds, and standard active safety features. You get the hardware (cameras and radar) necessary for autopilot, but <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/04/tesla-autopilots-hero-moment-just-taste-whats-come/">the software that actually lets you take your hands off the wheel</a> will cost you another $2,500. </p>
<p>Interestingly, the battery pack in this new car is in reality a more powerful 75-kWh pack, handicapped to perform as if it were a 60-kWh unit. For $9,500, you can unlock the car at any point with an over-the-air software update, and snag a 19 percent range bump. </p>
<p>Though it’s possible there are other practical benefits to offering this battery, Tesla says the price drop is a response to potential customers “who would like to buy a Model S, but can more easily afford it only at a lower price point.” </p>
<p>Whatever the reasoning, there’s symbolism here. For the past decade, Musk has been promising an electric car for the hoi polloi, to do in this century what Ford’s Model T did in the last. That car <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/03/meet-teslas-model-3-long-awaited-car-masses/">will be the Model 3</a>, the $30,000 car Tesla showed off in March, but won’t start building until late 2017, at the earliest. </p>
<p>This Model S is no working man’s car, but it’s a step closer to the masses. </p>
