<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocatio&lt;/span&gt;n">Arizona has run out of execution drugs, including a sedative implicated in botched lethal injections, according to a filing on Friday in a court case challenging the U.S. state's execution methods.</span></p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The Arizona Department of Corrections' supply of midazolam, a sedative, expired on May 31 and it has not been able to replace it, state lawyers said in the filing in Phoenix's U.S. District Court.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>"What is more, the Department's source of midazolam has vanished under pressure from death penalty opponents," the court document said.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The lawsuit was filed on behalf of seven death-row inmates who allege that Arizona's use of midazolam and two other drugs violate the U.S. Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Since midazolam was at the heart of the lawsuit, the filing  asked the judge hearing the case, Neil Wake, to decide whether the suit was moot.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The document said the Department of Corrections also lacked the execution drugs pentobarbital and sodium thiopental.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Arizona has not carried out an execution since the July 2014 execution of Joseph Wood. He was administered 14 times the allowed doses of midazolam and a narcotic, hydromorphone, and took almost two hours to die.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Midazolam, a relative of Valium, has also been cited in a troubled 2014 execution in Oklahoma. It was at the center of a U.S. Supreme Court decision last year where the court upheld its use in Oklahoma.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>After the high court's ruling, Arizona switched to a three-step protocol of midazolam, a paralytic drug and potassium chloride, which stops the heart.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>The protocol was the same as that decided in the Supreme Court case, and state lawyers have argued that midazolam thus was acceptable for use in Arizona.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>But Wake has ruled that Supreme Court decisions in the Oklahoma case and another involving midazolam were based only on the facts specific to them.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Drug company Pfizer Inc (<span id="symbol_PFE.N_0">PFE.N</span>) said last month it had banned the sale of execution drugs, including midazolam. The move cut off the last major U.S. source for drugs in the deadly mixes.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>The number of inmates executed in the United State has plummeted since the 1990s, with 14 executions so far this year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><span id="midArticle_14"/><p> (Reporting by Ian Simpson in Washington; Editing by Mary Milliken)</p><span id="midArticle_15"/></div>
