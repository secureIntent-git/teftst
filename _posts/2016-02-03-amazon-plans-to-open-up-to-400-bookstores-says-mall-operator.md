<span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocatio&lt;/span&gt;n">Amazon.com Inc (<span id="symbol_AMZN.O_0">AMZN.O</span>) plans to open up to 400 physical bookstores, an executive of a major U.S. mall operator said on Tuesday. </span></p></span><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>Amazon dipped its toe into the waters of brick-and-mortar stores with the opening of a bookstore in its home city of Seattle in November. An expansion of bookstores, which the company has not confirmed, would be a surprise reversal from the online retailer credited with driving physical booksellers out of business.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>"You've got Amazon opening brick-and-mortar bookstores and their goal is to open, as I understand, 300 to 400 bookstores," Sandeep Mathrani, chief executive of General Growth Properties Inc (<span id="symbol_GGP.N_1">GGP.N</span>), said on Tuesday, responding to an analyst's question after it reported earnings. </p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>On the call, Mathrani compared Amazon's plans to similar moves by eyeware company Warby Parker or men's clothing retailer Bonobos, both of which opened physical stores after finding success online.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>An Amazon spokeswoman said the company does not comment on "rumors and speculation."</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Before branching out to offer everything from fresh groceries to original TV programming, Amazon got its start as a bookseller 20 years ago. It has since revolutionized the publishing industry by introducing its popular e-reader, the Kindle. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Amazon's bookstore in Seattle carries books selected based on customer ratings and popularity on Amazon.com. The storefront also provides a space for visitors to test-drive Amazon's Kindle, Fire TV and other devices.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Any move by Amazon to expand stores would further antagonize long-time rivals like Barnes &amp; Noble Inc (<span id="symbol_BKS.N_2">BKS.N</span>), the largest U.S. bookstore chain, which operated 640 bookstores across the United States as of January. Shares of Barnes &amp; Noble fell more than 5 percent on Tuesday.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>The Wall Street Journal first reported Mathrani's comments on Tuesday. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Kevin Berry, vice president of investor relations at General Growth Properties, declined to comment beyond what was said during the conference call.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><span id="midArticle_10"/><p> (Reporting by Ismail Shakil in Bengaluru and <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=mari.saito&amp;">Mari Saito</a> in San Francisco; Editing by <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=savio.dsouza&amp;">Savio D'Souza</a>, Robin Paxton and Leslie Adler)</p><span id="midArticle_11"/></div>
