				<p>The first trailer for <em>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</em> dropped today, and it's chock full of new information about the Gareth Edwards-directed stand-alone film. It’s a trailer with no lightsabers, no Jedi, no Sith, and no major characters from any previous <em>Star Wars</em> films. But it’s a testament to the franchise that even without those major markers, this is still a thrilling teaser. Below are nine GIFs we plucked from the 90-second teaser to highlight the moments sure to fuel rampant speculation about the plot, the characters, and how <em>Rogue One</em> will connect to the larger <em>Star Wars</em> universe.</p>
