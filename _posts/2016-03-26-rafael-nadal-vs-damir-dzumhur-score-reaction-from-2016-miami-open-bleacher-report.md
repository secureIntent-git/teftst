    <p class="ui-droppable"><span>Bosnian </span>Damir<span> </span>Dzumhur beat <span>Rafael Nadal (ret.) </span>2-6, 6-4, 3-0 in the second round of the 2016 Miami Open on Saturday after he was forced to retire in the third set. The Spaniard couldn't continue after a series of talks with the trainers and repeated checks on his blood pressure.</p>
<p class="ui-droppable">But Dzumhur rebounded well after consulting the doctors himself at the end of the first set.</p>
<p>Nadal found himself pegged back early as Dzumhur saved a series of break points to even the score at a game apiece in the first set.</p>
<p>The tournament's official site noted how neither player was making quick work of things in the unforgiving Florida heat:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" readability="5.7142857142857"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nadal vs. Dzumhur has been underway for 16 minutes. The score is only 1-1. </p><p>Settle in, everyone. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MiamiOpen?src=hash">#MiamiOpen</a> <a href="https://t.co/7cRxlaFKML">pic.twitter.com/7cRxlaFKML</a></p>— Miami Open (@MiamiOpen) <a href="https://twitter.com/MiamiOpen/status/713804664169480192">March 26, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>But Nadal did take the next three games before winning the set 6-2.</p>
<p>Mistakes on serve were a consistent issue for Dzumhur. He was guilty of a quintet of double-faults and 14 unforced errors during the opening set, per TennisTV:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" readability="3.0989010989011"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">6-2 but it took 43 minutes and 12 break points for <a href="https://twitter.com/RafaelNadal">@RafaelNadal</a>! <a href="https://twitter.com/DzumhurDamir">@DzumhurDamir</a> calls the doc <a href="https://t.co/kRsZ9udpkC">https://t.co/kRsZ9udpkC</a> <a href="https://t.co/iShS1dIHJ8">pic.twitter.com/iShS1dIHJ8</a></p>— TennisTV (@TennisTV) <a href="https://twitter.com/TennisTV/status/713811597152620544">March 26, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>Still, an under-the-weather Dzumhur fared much better in the second set. He held on serve in the second game to even things at 1-1, just as he had in the first set.</p>
<p>Dzumhur's momentary surge threatened to turn into a full shift in momentum when he won his first break point to take a 2-1 lead in the set. He also took the next game to cap a prolific run of points-taking:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" readability="2.5827814569536"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">3-1 in the second as <a href="https://twitter.com/DzumhurDamir">@DzumhurDamir</a> goes on a roll!   <a href="https://t.co/kRsZ9udpkC">https://t.co/kRsZ9udpkC</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MiamiOpen?src=hash">#MiamiOpen</a> <a href="https://t.co/ma2fqD2p5U">pic.twitter.com/ma2fqD2p5U</a></p>— TennisTV (@TennisTV) <a href="https://twitter.com/TennisTV/status/713816058470207488">March 26, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>Nadal managed to hold serve after falling two games behind. Still, he couldn't produce a break of his own and was soon faced with another two-game deficit.</p>
<p>The Spaniard was struggling to deal with the fast pace Dzumhur was setting. The Bosnian was restarting quickly between points on his serve.</p>
<p>Nadal's best counter proved to be his backhand, which settled more than a few rallies during the second set. TennisTV relayed highlights of one particularly memorable shot:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" readability="2.6068965517241"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Watch <a href="https://twitter.com/RafaelNadal">@RafaelNadal</a> unleash a monster backhand! <a href="https://t.co/kRsZ9udpkC">https://t.co/kRsZ9udpkC</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MiamiOpen?src=hash">#MiamiOpen</a> <a href="https://t.co/mjWrtoKmG9">https://t.co/mjWrtoKmG9</a></p>— TennisTV (@TennisTV) <a href="https://twitter.com/TennisTV/status/713820354263785472">March 26, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>But another break point left Dzumhur serving for the set. A pair of cute drop shots foiled Nadal's familiar backhand for Dzumhur's first point, before an ace and an unforced error handed the Bosnian a trio of set points.</p>
<p>Another ace won it to leave a suddenly sluggish Nadal rattled.</p>
<p>A buoyant Dzumhur was two games up in the third when Nadal stopped play for a long consultation with the trainers and medics, who checked on his blood pressure. But the respite did nothing to improve Nadal's fortunes, as Dzumhur broke serve again.</p>
<p>Two breaks adrift, Nadal opted to continue after taking some more fluids before the fourth game. But just three points in, the Spaniard decided he couldn't go on.</p>
<p>WTA Insider Courtney Nguyen speculated on the cause of his problems:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" readability="3.5658914728682"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Did not appear to be injury. Either illness or heat.  <a href="https://t.co/Rwax2mBZ44">https://t.co/Rwax2mBZ44</a></p>— Courtney Nguyen (@FortyDeuceTwits) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortyDeuceTwits/status/713827801657393152">March 26, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, ESPN's Howard Bryant noted how long it's been since Nadal has had to stop early:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center" readability="6.3098591549296"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">Nadal. Retires. First retirement since 2010 Australian Open. Dzumhur d. Nadal 2-6, 6-4, 3-0 (ret)</p>— Howard Bryant (@hbryant42) <a href="https://twitter.com/hbryant42/status/713827663803191296">March 26, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>With <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/roger-federer">Roger Federer</a> also withdrawing, per <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/35901070">BBC Sport</a>, Nadal's exit is another high-profile one for the tournament. But credit to Dzumhur, who rallied from his own medical concern to boss the match. Had Nadal continued, it's unlikely he'd have pegged Dzumhur back on this form.  </p>
