<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">SAN FRANCISCO</span> Uber has raised $3.5 billion from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the U.S. ride-hailing service said on Wednesday, gaining a crucial partner in its expansion into the Middle East.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The investment from the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund was part of Uber's most recent financing round that valued the company at $62.5 billion, Uber said, making it the most highly valued venture capital-backed company in the world.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>In a written statement, Uber co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick called the investment a "vote of confidence in our business." </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>As part of the investment, a managing director at the Saudi fund, Yasir Al Rumayyan, will take a seat on Uber's board, the company said. Other board members include Benchmark Capital general partner Bill Gurley and Huffington Post co-founder Arianna Huffington.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Uber said the Saudi's investment puts the company's total balance sheet, including cash and debt, at more than $11 billion.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>The funding round is a departure from the startup investing climate, which has seen contraction in recent months as technology companies face greater scrutiny over their valuations. It shows that the some of the most high-profile companies with mass consumer adoption -- among them also Snapchat, which last week disclosed a $1.81 billion funding raise -- can still demand investor dollars, even as other tech firms are downsizing to weather a funding drought.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Uber has committed to investing $250 million in the Middle East and North Africa, where it has grown aggressively and is now operating in nine countries and 15 cities in the region. But, as in other regions including China and India, Uber is competing in the Middle East against local ride-hailing startups such as Careem, which operates in 20 cities across the region.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>In the first quarter of the year, Uber had more than 395,000 active riders across the region, a five-fold jump from the first quarter of 2015, and 19,000 active drivers, representing a four-fold increase over the same period.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Uber says it has operated in Saudi Arabia since early 2014 and about 80 percent of its more than 130,000 riders in that country are women.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><span id="midArticle_10"/><p> (Reporting by Heather Somerville; Editing by Tiffany Wu and Tom Brown)</p><span id="midArticle_11"/></div>
