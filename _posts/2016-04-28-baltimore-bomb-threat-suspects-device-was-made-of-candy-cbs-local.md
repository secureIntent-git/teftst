<p><strong>BALTIMORE (WJZ)</strong> — A man claiming to have a bomb strapped to his chest threatened a Baltimore TV station Thursday afternoon, and was later shot by police after walking out of the building.</p>
<p>At a 5:30 p.m. press conference, police said the man is 25 years old and not from Baltimore. He is at the hospital receiving treatment and is expected to survive.</p>
<div id="attachment_592093" style="width: 430px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-592093" src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Baltimore-Bomb-Threat-Suspect039s-Device-Was-Made-of-Candy-CBS-Local.jpg" alt="Photo credit: WJZ-TV" width="420" height="236" title="Baltimore Bomb Threat Suspects Device Was Made of Candy"/><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo credit: WJZ-TV</p></div>
<p>The explosive device he claimed to have was actually chocolate candy bars wrapped in wires, with another device meant to look like a detonator running down his sleeve.</p>
<p>It all started around 1:20 p.m. at Fox 45 in the Woodberry section of Baltimore, just blocks away from us at WJZ-TV and NBC affiliate WBAL-TV.</p>
<p>A security guard with Fox 45 tells <strong>WJZ</strong> <strong>reporter George Solis</strong> that the man walked into the station wearing a hedgehog onesie outfit and medical mask, claiming he had a bomb.</p>
<p>“He pretty much said he had a bomb on him and that he … had a message that he needed to be heard,” said the security guard.</p>
<p>The security guard said the suspect had a flash drive containing files that had to do with astronomy.</p>

<p>“It pretty much had to do with anything with astronomy … black holes, the sun, about it being liquid and gas, and he just wanted to say that the government was wrong in thinking about the way they do when it comes to anything in space,” said the guard.</p>
<p>Just after 3 p.m. the suspect walked out of the station, refusing to take his hands out of his pockets.</p>
<p>Baltimore Police spokesperson T.J. Smith says the suspect was then shot at least three times after refusing demands by police.</p>

<p>No other injuries have been reported in relation to the incident.</p>
<p>Just before 4:30 p.m. the suspect was taken away in an ambulance.</p>
<p>Before news of the bomb threat broke, Fox 45 reporter Paul Gessler initially reported a fire in their parking lot.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.periscope.tv/w/afDtojExMzg5MDR8MU9kS3JReWVabXF4WN99Fjz4BcfZvyFldIyIns5zGMhrAw_RoEQgP2QXROb1">Gessler live streamed the incident on Periscope </a>which showed vehicle’s gas tank on fire.</p>
<p>Police say that the fire is now being investigated an an arson.</p>
<p>“Outside of the building a vehicle was set on fire,” said Smith. “It appears to be arson related. There was a rag inside of the gas tank area of the vehicle. There was no type of explosion, no type of bomb detonated at any time.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Authorities remain on the scene and plan to conduct a thorough investigation throughout the night.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time a person has threatened a Baltimore TV station.</p>
