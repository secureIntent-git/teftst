<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocation">WASHINGTON</span> U.S. Vice President Joe Biden called on Israel's government on Sunday to demonstrate its commitment to a two-state solution to end the conflict with the Palestinians and said settlement expansion is weakening prospects for peace.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>"Israel's government's steady and systematic process of expanding settlements, legalizing outposts, seizing land, is eroding in my view the prospect of a two-state solution," Biden said in a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a leading pro-Israel lobbying group.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Biden said he did not agree with Israel President Benjamin Netanyahu's government that expanded settlements would not interfere with any effort to settle the conflict.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"Bibi (Netanyahu) thinks it can be accommodated, and I believe he believes it. I don't," Biden said.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Biden said the region instead seems to be moving toward a one-state solution, which he termed dangerous.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"There is no political will at this moment among Israelis or Palestinians to move forward with serious negotiations. And that's incredibly disappointing," Biden said. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Israel says it intends to keep large settlement blocs in any future peace agreement with the Palestinians. Palestinians, who seek to establish a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, say they fear Israeli settlement expansion will deny them a viable country.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Palestinians have cited Israeli settlement activity as one of the factors behind the collapse of U.S.-brokered peace talks in 2014, and a surge of violence over the past five months has  dimmed hopes negotiations could be revived any time soon.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>"We've stressed to both parties the need to take meaningful steps to demonstrate their commitment to a two-state solution that extends beyond mere words," Biden said.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>"There's got to be a little 'show-me.' This cannot continue to erode," he said.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Biden was cheered for criticizing what he called Palestinian actions at the United Nations to undermine Israel, and he said changes in the region, including the united fight against Islamic State militants, could help thaw relations between Israel and its neighbors.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Israel and the United States are also in talks on a generous military assistance agreement, he said. </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>"It will, without a doubt, be the most generous security assistance package in the history of the United States," Biden said of a pact expected to be worth billions of dollars annually to the Jewish state, the largest recipient of such U.S. assistance.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><span id="midArticle_14"/><span id="midArticle_15"/><p> (Reporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Richard Pullin)</p><span id="midArticle_16"/></div>
