That case has been in the public eye because of <em>Making a Murderer,</em> a 10-part Netflix documentary that chronicles the trial and conviction of Manitowoc County residents Steven Avery and Brendan Dassey for Halbach's murder.</p><p>"The caller made statement of getting 'justice for Steven' in an apparent reference to Steven Avery," Manitowoc police said via Twitter.</p><p>Police, using dogs, searched the area but did not find a device. They gave the all-clear shortly after 9 p.m.</p><p>"Approximately 20 minutes to 7 tonight, a bomb threat was called in to the sheriff's department," Manitowoc City Police Capt. Larry Zimney said earlier in the night. The caller claimed "there were bombs in and around the building."</p><p>Officers and bomb-sniffing dogs checked the area about 8:15 p.m., but found nothing, Zimney said.</p><div id="module-position-Ox_i4khHvT4" class="story-asset image-asset" readability="33"><aside itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" class="wide single-photo" readability="6"><img itemprop="url" src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Bomb-threat-targets-039Making-a-Murderer039-sheriff-USA-TODAY.jpg" alt="Protesters move to the Manitowoc County Sheriff's Department" width="540" height="405" data-mycapture-src="" data-mycapture-sm-src=""/><meta itemprop="name" content="635896776026075611-uscpcent02-6o7jagwwconr2hnpc1r-original.jpg"/><meta itemprop="height" content="405"/><meta itemprop="width" content="540"/><p>Protesters move to the Manitowoc County Sheriff's Department to speak their mind.
