The Pershing chief Square Capital Management invested $1 billion in a short bet against Herbalife's shares in 2012 when they traded around $47.</p><p>Herbalife stock (<a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=HLF">HLF</a>) rose 6.6% in pre-market trading Friday to $63.25.</p><p>Still, the FTC blasted Herbalife for exaggerating the earnings most of its sellers reap and said Herbalife agreed to pay for an independent auditor to monitor its business practices.</p><p>"Herbalife is going to have to start operating legitimately, making only truthful claims about how much money its members are likely to make, and it will have to compensate consumers for the losses they have suffered as a result of what we charge are unfair and deceptive practices," FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said in a statement.</p><p>Only a "small minority" of distributors make "a lot of money" on Herbalife sales, the FTC said, and most abandon the business within the year.</p><p>Owners of Herbalife's Nutrition Club brand invested an average of $8,500 to launch their operation, but 57% broke even or lost money, according to an internal survey revealed by the FTC.</p><p>Follow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @<a href="http://twitter.com/nathanbomey">NathanBomey</a>.</p><!-- cxenseparse_end --><p>Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/29HiG0c</p></div>
