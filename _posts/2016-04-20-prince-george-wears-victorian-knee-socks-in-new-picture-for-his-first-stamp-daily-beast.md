<br><p>There are so many firsts in those precious early years—first steps, first tooth, and first word. But there are few of us indeed who get a first stamp.</p><div readability="70.840100723953"><div class="wrapper text" readability="32"><p>What is it with Prince George and the knee socks?</p></div><div class="wrapper text" readability="25.315068493151"><p>The much-derided, faux-Victorian legwear <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2014/01/16/will-prince-george-be-photographed-down-under.html">which George seems to be obliged to wear on every formal occasion</a> items have made another appearance today, as Prince George ticks off a very royal first – one’s first stamp.</p>
</div><noscript/><div class="wrapper text" readability="32.9375"><p>George makes his appearance to celebrate his grandmother the Queen’s 90<sup>th</sup> birthday (her <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/cheats/2013/06/15/queen-celebrates-official-birthday.html">real</a> one) which is tomorrow, Thursday.</p>
</div><div class="wrapper text" readability="32"><p>The stamp of Prince George is being sold as part of a special presentation pack. </p></div><div class="wrapper text" readability="38"><p>A group photograph was taken featuring the line of succession; the Queen, the heir to the throne (Charles) the heir to the heir of the throne (William) and George, socks and all, the heir to the heir of the heir the throne. You peel out the heads of the various royals from the picture and stick them on your envelope to post it.</p></div><div class="wrapper text" readability="34"><p>The two-year-old future king had to stand on blocks to make him the right height for the picture, and in fact his signature socks have been cropped from the final stamp presentation pack.<br/></p></div><div class="InlineImage"><figure class="Image"><div><img title="rm2" alt="" src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Prince-George-Wears-Victorian-Knee-Socks-In-New-Picture-For-His-First-Stamp-Daily-Beast.cac"/></div></figure></div><div class="wrapper text" readability="32.907079646018"><p>Sock fanatics will be interested to know that Prince George’s knee socks are  from <a href="http://www.amaiakids.co.uk/engine/shop/index.html">Amaia Kids</a>, a boutique located in Chelsea Green.  He is also, my sources tell me, wearing the brand’s <a href="http://www.amaiakids.co.uk/engine/shop/product/AW14%2F15+GRIOTTE+NAVY+BLOOMERS/GRIOTTE">Griotte Bloomer</a> in navy corduroy.</p>
</div><div class="wrapper text" readability="41"><p>The bloomers are usually available in a variety of colors, including royal blue, yellow and beige, but will all be sold out in a few hours time, no doubt. </p>
<p>But we reckon you should still be able to get your hands on the socks, as they are presumably not huge global sellers.

</div><div class="wrapper text" readability="38"><p>Photographer Ranald Mackechnie, who according to the Daily Telegraph was sworn to such secrecy that he did not even tell his wife he took the picture (hmmm) said: “George was absolutely charming, as you can see from the picture. You only have a short window of opportunity with small children, but Prince George was on good form and everyone seemed to enjoy seeing him enjoy the day.</p></div><div class="wrapper text" readability="35"><p>“He was fascinated by my lights and all the kit, and he was quite happy standing on the blocks. I took maybe 80 or 100 shots, but when I saw this one I knew straight away that was it.”</p></div><div class="wrapper text" readability="32"><p>The shoot was not without hitches. </p></div><div class="wrapper text" readability="38"><p>“When the Royal family came into the room and sat down, my computer system crashed,” he said. “Prince Charles was very sympathetic, and saved my blushes, and fortunately I had back-up so we were back up and running in about a minute.”</p></div><div class="wrapper text" readability="34"><p>Royal Mail is also issuing a set of six commemorative stamps showing the Queen in her public and private roles over the past 90 years. All of the stamps will be available from Post Offices from Thursday.</p></div><div class="wrapper text" readability="37"><p>Photographer Ranald Mackechnie, was chosen due to 'his excellent use of light in his work and specialist portrait skills', Royal Mail said. Ranald had worked with the Royal Mail design team many times; however, this was the first time his work would feature on a stamp.<br/></p>
</div><div class="wrapper text" readability="38"><p>The photographic team looked at a range of rooms within the Palace and originally selected the Yellow Drawing Room as it was the preferred choice of the photographer. However, after reviewing the initial test shots, the team felt that the White Drawing Room would best capture the sense of this special portrait, without overpowering the actual photograph.</p></div></div>
