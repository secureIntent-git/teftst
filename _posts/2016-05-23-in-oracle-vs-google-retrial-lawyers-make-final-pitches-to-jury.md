<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">SAN FRANCISCO</span> Oracle Corp (<span id="symbol_ORCL.N_0">ORCL.N</span>) filed a multibillion-dollar copyright lawsuit against Google because Oracle failed in its own attempts to enter the smartphone market, a Google attorney said in closing arguments on Monday.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>In a retrial in federal court in San Francisco, Oracle Corp has claimed Google's Android smartphone operating system violated its copyright on parts of Java, a development platform. Alphabet Inc's (<span id="symbol_GOOGL.O_1">GOOGL.O</span>) Google unit said it should be able to use Java without paying a fee under the fair-use provision of copyright law.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>A trial in 2012 ended in a deadlocked jury, and if the current jury rules against Google on fair use, then it would consider Oracle's request for about $9 billion in damages.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The case has been closely watched by software developers, who fear an Oracle victory could spur more software copyright lawsuits.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>However, investors see little risk for Google because the company could afford to pay a onetime fine, and the possibility of an injunction that would force Google to pay ongoing royalties to Oracle appears remote.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>In court on Monday, Google attorney Robert Van Nest played a video of a speech by Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison praising "our friends at Google" for building devices that use Java. Ellison then suggested Oracle should also build similar hardware.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>But Oracle was never able to build a smartphone of its own, Van Nest said, so it decided to accuse Google of unfair copying instead.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>"They now want all the credit and a whole lot of money," Van Nest said. "That's not fair."</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
