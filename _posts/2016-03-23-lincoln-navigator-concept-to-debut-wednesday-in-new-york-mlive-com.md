		<p>NEW YORK – Lincoln is unveiling an all-new Navigator Concept Wednesday at the 2016 New York International Auto Show.</p>
<p>We'll have more details after a press conference set for 10:45 a.m., but one of the most curious pieces of information from Lincoln on the new SUV is that it will have gull-wing doors. </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Lincoln confirmed that instead of four traditional doors on the side, the full-size SUV concept will instead have two large doors that swing open vertically. </p>
<p>We'll have plenty of photos and video of that shortly after the presser. </p>
<p>Interior comfort will play a key role in the SUV's features. Its seats can adjust 30 ways to accommodate the comfort of a wide variety of passengers, for example. </p>
<p>The Navigator concept has a 3.5-liter V-6 that delivers 400 horsepower. </p>
<p>The concept SUV is meant to offer a glimpse of what comes next for the brand's best-selling nameplate. </p>
<p>"The all-new Navigator Concept reinforces our commitment to give every Lincoln client what we call quiet luxury – vehicles and experiences that are elegant, effortlessly powerful and serene," Kumar Galhotra, president of Lincoln, said in a statement. "This kind of quiet luxury sets Lincoln apart. Now, we're showing fans of large SUVs how we can exceed their expectations, without being the loudest statement on the road."</p>
<p>Press preview days for this year's New York auto show are March 23 and 24. Several new cars and trucks are expected to be unveiled from brands such as Lincoln, Acura and Nissan. </p>
<p>The 116-year-old event at the Jacob K. Javits Center will then open to the public from March 25 to April 3. More information: <a href="http://www.autoshowny.com/">www.autoshowny.com</a>.</p>
