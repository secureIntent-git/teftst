However, ownership of on the Nobel medal "must be resolved by a fact-finder at trial," the judge wrote.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>The case has been in mediation, with former President Jimmy Carter participating, but "such a settlement has, so far, eluded the parties," McBurney said in his ruling.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
