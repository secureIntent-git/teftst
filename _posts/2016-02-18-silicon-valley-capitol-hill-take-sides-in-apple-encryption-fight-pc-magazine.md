<br><div id=""><p>Apple has some heavyweight supporters in its encryption battle with the FBI, but a number of politicians, particularly the GOP presidential hopefuls, are not on board.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>In a series of tweets, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said a recent court order requiring Apple to unlock a seized iPhone "could be a troubling precedent."</p>&#13;
&#13;
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" readability="4.9668874172185">&#13;
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/5 Important post by <a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook">@tim_cook</a>. Forcing companies to enable hacking could compromise users' privacy</p>&#13;
&#13;
— sundarpichai (@sundarpichai) <a href="https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/700104298600886272">February 17, 2016</a></blockquote>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>"We know that law enforcement and intelligence agencies face significant challenges in protecting the public against crime and terrorism," Pichai said. "We build secure products to keep your information safe and we give law enforcement access to data based on valid legal orders. But that's wholly different than requiring companies to enable hacking of customer devices and data."</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Pichai's tweets come after a court ordered Apple to help the iPhone unlock an iPhone owned by one of the San Bernardino shooters. The iPhone 5c is currently locked, and the FBI does not want to trigger an auto-wipe function if it makes too many incorrect password guesses. So it wants Apple to remove the remote-wipe function so it can start an automated password-guessing process.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Apple, however, has refused to comply. It says the order is a slippery slope because if Apple creates a workaround for the FBI, what's to stop that from falling into the hands of terrorists or other criminals, who might use it for nefarious purposes?</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>"The government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers—including tens of millions of American citizens—from sophisticated hackers and cybercriminals," Cook wrote in <a href="http://www.apple.com/customer-letter/" target="_blank">a Tuesday letter</a> published to the company's website.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>The memo attracted the attention of everyone from WhatsApp creator Jan Koum to <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/16/02/18/protestors-gather-at-san-francisco-apple-store-to-support-apples-fight-against-government-backdoors" target="_blank">Internet rights advocates</a> to presidential hopefuls.</p>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>The Reform Government Surveillance campaign, meanwhile, of which Microsoft is a member, on Wednesday <a href="http://reformgs.tumblr.com/post/139513553507/reform-government-surveillance-statement" target="_blank">said</a> "it is extremely important to deter terrorists and criminals and to help law enforcement by processing legal orders for information in order to keep us all safe.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>"But technology companies should not be required to build in backdoors to the technologies that keep their users' information secure," it continued. "RGS companies remain committed to providing law enforcement with the help it needs while protecting the security of their customers and their customers' information."</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, meanwhile, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-donald-trump-blasts-apple-133241253.html" target="_blank">criticized Apple</a> for denying the government request. "To think that Apple won't allow us into [the] cell phone? Who do they think they are?" he said during a Wednesday <i>Fox &amp; Friends</i> interview. "No, we have to open it."</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>During a CNN town hall on Wednesday, Sen. Ted Cruz had a <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-02172016-htmlstory.html#2974" target="_blank">similar take</a>, as did <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-gop-town-hall-20160217-story.html" target="_blank">Ben Carson</a>. Sen. Marco Rubio, however, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/marco-rubio-apple-fbi-encryption-privacy-backdoors-2016-2" target="_blank">acknowledged</a> the unintended consequences of creating a backdoor. "<span>I don't have a magic solution for it today — it's a complicated new issue," he said.</span></p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton went a step further, <a href="http://www.cotton.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=319" target="_blank">saying</a> that Apple is protecting a dead ISIS terrorist's privacy over the security of the American people.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>"The problem of end-to-end encryption isn't just a terrorism issue. It is also a drug-trafficking, kidnapping, and child pornography issue that impacts every state of the Union," Cotton said in a statement. "It's unfortunate that the great company Apple is becoming the company of choice for terrorists, drug dealers, and sexual predators of all sorts."</p>&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
<p>Apple started encrypting its mobile OS by default beginning with iOS 8, and Google did the same with Lollipop. The move was in large part a response to the Edward Snowden docs and revelations that the feds were using more invasive technology to spy on citizens than most people thought.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>States like <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-01-15/new-york-bill-aims-to-ban-encrypted-phones" target="_blank">New York</a> and <a class="" href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2498249,00.asp">California</a> have introduced bills that would ban the sale of encrypted devices. Last week, however, two members of Congress <a class="" href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2499117,00.asp">introduced a bill</a> that would thwart state efforts to weaken smartphone encryption.</p>&#13;
