<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="6"><p><span class="articleLocation">OSLO</span> Internet browser Vivaldi, which launched last week, must attract five million monthly users to become profitable, its founder and chief executive said in a Reuters interview.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The introduction of Vivaldi version 1.0 follows a 15-month development that cost veteran software maker Jon von Tetzchner around 50 million crowns ($6.07 million) of his own money.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Offering a wide range of personalized settings and bookmark functions, the Oslo-based browser hopes to lure some of the web's most demanding users away from global brands like Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari and Opera.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"A few years ago everyone started simplifying their browsers and they removed many of the features that the so-called power users wanted. This is the segment we are targeting", von Tetzchner said.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>"We have many more features and personalization options than any other browser in the market. Most of these features are new and totally unique for Vivaldi," he added.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Named after the 18th-century composer Antonio Vivaldi, the name hints at von Tetzchner's previous role as co-founder and long-time head of browser and mobile phone software firm Opera, which he left in 2011.    </p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Opera is now the subject of an ongoing $1.28 billion takeover by a group of Chinese firms.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>"After I left they decided to focus on a totally different user segment, and that opened up a space in the market," von Tetzchner said. "We only need five million monthly users to make money and I'm confident that we will get there."</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Vivaldi has been downloaded several million times since the launch of a test version early last year, but von Tetzchner declined to say how many of those had become regular users.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>

I'm fortunate to be able to do that this time around."</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Vivaldi has also partnered with several content providers including Bing, Yahoo and Yandex and is in talks with Alphabet, von Tetzchner said.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>($1 = 8.2381 Norwegian crowns)</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><span id="midArticle_16"/><p> (Editing by Terje Solsvik)</p><span id="midArticle_17"/></div>
