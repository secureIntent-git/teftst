<p>Set to be released on June 28, <em>LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em> will bring Finn, Rey, and the grizzled majesty of an aging Han Solo to every videogame platform you can imagine. Warner Bros. also announced that the game will include new story details, with some of the game’s content set in the murky 30-year gap between <em>Return of the Jedi</em> and <em>The Force Awakens</em>. </p>

<p>The LEGO videogame franchise, which began with <em>LEGO Star Wars</em> back in 2005, has to date sold over 33 million copies, according to Warner Bros., which acquired its developer TT Games in 2007. It’s not hard to see why: the franchise’s simple platforming and wry humor make for charming games. </p>
<p>For <em>The Force Awakens</em>, developer TT Games is promising expanded building options, space dogfighting, and pitched blaster battles against the First Order. Hey, maybe this time Captain Phasma will even get to do something. </p>
