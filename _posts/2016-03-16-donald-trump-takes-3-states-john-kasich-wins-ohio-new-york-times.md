Mr. Kasich’s victory in Ohio dealt Mr. Trump a stinging blow, preventing him from claiming the state’s 66 delegates and significantly increasing the chances that the Republican race will not be decided until the July convention. Mr. Trump now needs to win close to 60 percent of the delegates in the remaining contests to capture the nomination before then.</p><figure id="2016-03-15-results-embed" class="interactive interactive-embedded  has-adjacency limit-small layout-small"><a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-8">Continue reading the main story</a>

Just three weeks ago, Republican leaders were complaining that Mr. Kasich, who until Tuesday had not won a single state, was ensuring Mr. Trump’s nomination by remaining in the race. Now, he has revived hopes on the right that Mr. Trump can be stopped.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="337" data-total-count="4523" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Kasich’s victory in Ohio also shined a light on a nagging difficulty for Mr. Trump, and one of the Republican race’s most revealing divides: the class fault line. While Mr. Trump won among voters who earn less than $50,000 a year, Mr. Kasich overwhelmed him by more 30 percentage points among Ohioans who make more than $100,000.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="218" data-total-count="4741" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-9">Despite his Ohio win, Mr. Kasich was likely to emerge with fewer than 150 delegates over all — less than Mr. Rubio’s total.

But he has been unsuccessful in ending the nomination fight early, and each time he has seemed to gain a clear upper hand, he has given mainstream Republicans a spectacular reminder of why they have long resisted him.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="492" data-total-count="7576" itemprop="articleBody">Two days before his <a title="Times article." href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/02/us/politics/republican-primary-results.html">Super Tuesday victories</a> on March 1, he startled the party by initially <a title="Times article." href="http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/02/28/donald-trump-declines-to-disavow-david-duke/">declining to disavow</a> the endorsement of David Duke, the white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan leader.

In all five of the states that held primaries, slightly less than half of Republican voters said they considered Mr. Trump honest and trustworthy, according to exit polls. And he has trailed Hillary Clinton in general election polls, often by wide margins.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="179" data-total-count="8792" itemprop="articleBody">Mrs. Clinton, who has also faced questions about her personal integrity, was deemed honest and trustworthy by a majority of Democratic primary voters in each of those five states.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="285" data-total-count="9077" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Trump’s opponents have also been increasingly bold in confronting him, albeit belatedly. They have criticized his character and raised the prospect that they might be unwilling to cast a vote for him under any circumstances — even in a general election against Hillary Clinton.</p>
