Jones, 28, looked tentative in his comeback, but was nevertheless dominant. All three judges scored it a sweep for Jones: 50-44, 50-45 and 50-45.</p><p>Even Jones, who picked up his 13th consecutive win in the contest, said he was disappointed with how it went.</p><p>"I was watching, imagining, anticipating techniques -- knowing when techniques would have landed, but just not going for it," Jones said. "Physically, I felt amazing. Mentally, I was like, 'Oh my God, I'm sucking. This isn't good.'"</p><p>In his postfight statements, Jones added that "everything happens for a reason." Originally, Jones was supposed to fight for the official title in a rematch against <a href="http://espn.go.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2509290/daniel-cormier">Daniel Cormier</a>, but Cormier suffered a leg injury and was forced to pull out of the event on April 1. Saint Preux (19-8) agreed to fill in on three weeks' notice.</p><p>"I was trying to be as confident as possible, but I really needed that fight," Jones said. "I didn't look at it as a warm-up fight, but as you can see, I needed that fight before I fight for my title."</p><p>Technically, Jones was crowned the interim champion, although that's a label he clearly has no interest in. As the UFC belt was presented to Jones after Saturday's fight, he declined to put it on, saying, "It's not the right belt."</p><aside class="inline inline-photo full"><figure><picture><source data-srcset="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2016%2F0423%2Fr76951_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&amp;w=570, http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2016%2F0423%2Fr76951_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&amp;w=1140&amp;cquality=40 2x" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2016%2F0423%2Fr76951_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&amp;w=375, http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2016%2F0423%2Fr76951_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&amp;w=750&amp;cquality=40 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"><img class=" lazyload lazyload" data-image-container=".inline-photo"/></source></source></picture><figcaption class="photoCaption">While Jon Jones, left, was crowned the interim light heavyweight champion on Saturday night, he had no interest in the label and declined to put on the belt, saying, "it's not the right belt."Â <cite>Rod Mar for ESPN</cite></figcaption></figure></aside><p>Jones was never in danger of losing to Saint Preux; he simply struggled to really put him away. Jones walked Saint Preux backward throughout and essentially landed strikes at will. His push kick to the body and legs was efficient, and when he closed distance and moved inside, he landed hard elbows upstairs.</p><p>Saint Preux seemed even more tentative than Jones. He landed a small handful of right hands that got Jones' attention, but nothing more. He seemed content to hang back and concede ground to Jones. He did display a good chin at times, standing up to a spinning kick to the head in the second round.</p><p>According to Fightmetric research, Jones outlanded Saint Preux in total strikes 131 to 58.</p><p>"I just wanted to come out here -- Jon is the pound-for-pound best fighter to ever come through mixed martial arts," Saint Preux said. "For me to come in here and do what I did, I'm pretty proud of myself. I only had three weeks to get ready. I gave it everything I had. I did a pretty good job."</p><p>After the fight remained a standup battle the first three rounds, Jones took Saint Preux down in the fourth and fifth, which led to his best offense of the night. He moved into mount in the fourth and dropped hard elbows and punches that had referee Herb Dean right on top of the action. Saint Preux was eventually saved by the bell.</p><p>The win sets Jones up to fight Cormier (17-1) later this year. After Jones was stripped of the belt, Cormier stepped in and won the vacant title by submitting <a href="http://espn.go.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2335663/anthony-johnson">Anthony Johnson</a> at UFC 187 in May. Cormier recorded one defense in October, winning a split decision over <a href="http://espn.go.com/mma/fighter/_/id/2500771/alexander-gustafsson">Alexander Gustafsson</a>.</p><p>Jones and Cormier met in a grudge match at UFC 182 in January last year, which Jones won in a unanimous decision.</p><p>"I'm really excited to fight Cormier," Jones said. "I'll be right back in practice, probably by Tuesday or Wednesday -- getting back to our original strategy."</p>
