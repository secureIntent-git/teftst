<br><div id=""><p>Now that it’s finally, really, almost spring where I live in Minneapolis, it’s time I got serious about my yard. Experts have told me that watering consistently is the only way to get a lush, green lawn. As I planned a tech-enabled automated watering system, I had visions of walking across my property like Jason Day evaluating his next putt at Augusta, not a single weed in sight.</p>

<br/>There are several devices you can use to schedule regular, consistent waterings. The most effective is an in-ground sprinkler system. The exorbitant cost—<a href="http://www.homeadvisor.com/cost/lawn-and-garden/install-a-sprinkler-system/">around $2,000, including equipment and labor</a>—gets you a system that stays hidden and is very efficient. You can also get an Internet-connected controller box that can be set by an app on your phone. The controllers like the ones from <a href="https://rachio.com">Rachio</a>, <a href="https://www.skydrop.com/">Skydrop</a>, and <a href="http://myblossom.com/">Blossom</a> can even gather weather data and pause your watering schedule on rainy days.
<p>There are ways, however, to get the benefits of a connected sprinkler system without spending thousands of dollars and digging trenches through the grass. I decided to put one such method to the test. By pairing <a href="http://www.lowes.com/pd_690404-41277-9402-L_0__?productId=999925318">Iris by Lowe’s Smart Home Hub</a> with two <a href="http://www.lowes.com/pd_586530-74985-27087_0__?productId=50140356">Orbit Iris Hose Faucet Timers</a>, I aimed to create an Internet-connected above-ground system that allows me to water my lawn using regular hoses and movable sprinklers, all controlled by taps on an iPhone screen. Total cost: well under $200.</p>
<h3>Installation Fun</h3>
<p>The hub and controllers are all part of the Iris smart home platform. It’s a Lowe’s product (yep, the hardware store), and the company sells dozens of devices made by different manufacturers that can all talk to each other. The hub acts like a traffic cop, relaying your commands and keeping everything working together. You can install things like smart power outlets, smart door locks, and motion-sensing security alarms, connect them to the hub, and control your entire house through the Iris app. The tiny Iris hub ($51) is required, and so is the free Iris app—though downloading the correct app is important. There’s a first-generation version of the Iris app and a new version, but both are in the store. It’s hard to tell the difference; both apps use a similar Iris logo, but one app is clearly marked first-gen. You want the new one.</p>

You connect your sprinkler hose to the out nozzle, then turn on the faucet and leave it on. The timer regulates the flow from there.</p>
<p>To get them online, you connect them to the Iris hub using <a href="http://www.zigbee.org/">ZigBee</a>, a short-range wireless protocol that’s very similar to Wi-Fi. You plug the hub into your Wi-Fi router using an Ethernet cable, install the app on your phone, then, after registering for a free Iris account, start building your network of devices. The hub beeps three times each time you connect something new.</p>
<p>If you have a large house or, like me, you’re trying to talk to devices outdoors, you may need a $30 <a href="http://support.irisbylowes.com/link/portal/30143/30206/Article/547/Next-Gen-Iris-Smart-Plug-with-Next-Gen">Iris Smart Plug</a>. This acts as connected outlet that you can switch on and off with your phone, but it also doubles as a repeater, creating a stronger ZigBee connection so the hub can talk to devices further away.</p>
<h3>Let the Watering Begin</h3>
<p>If your lawn is dry like the surface of Mars, you can click a button to water manually for a set duration—say, 15 minutes or four hours. Manual watering is not what I had in mind; I wanted automation. The Iris app has “cards” for things like your lighting, or your lawn and garden maintenance. I would have preferred the app asked about watering schedules as soon as I paired the faucet timers, but after some scrolling and poking, I figured out how the cards work. I set up a schedule for watering in the early morning and again at night. (The most efficient way to water your lawn.)</p>
<p>Amazingly, the timers worked perfectly and right on schedule. At 7 am, all of my sprinklers erupted right on cue. At 7PM, it happened again. Then, it happened all week. Over a period of about two weeks, my lawn started taking on a darker, healthier hue. The total cost for all of this was under $200.</p>
<p>My only minor complaint is that it’s a little weird leaving the faucets on at all times. They tend to drip a little, and I wondered if it wasted water. An in-ground system connects into your water lines directly and shuts off the flow. In some ways, automated sprinkling with hoses and sprinklers is a bit old-school, but it does provide extra flexibility. I ended up repositioning my sprinklers a few times. I also experimented with different sprinklers, including the kind that spray everywhere and the kind that offer spot coverage.</p>
<p>Then I hit on an idea. I set one faucet for lawn watering and another for my garden. I went back to the app and configured the garden watering schedule to be a little more aggressive—one full hour two times per day. The water pressure in my home was barely enough to make this all work, but it achieved my goal. I never had to hire someone to install an in-ground system, yet the results in my yard were remarkably similar. I even drank lemonade on a patio and watched it all happen. </p>
<p>I should note that the user reviews for the next-gen Iris system are extremely poor. Many customers are complaining about compatibility issues with their older Iris gear, and some have even decided to go back to solely using first-gen hardware and software. I was focused on automated sprinkling using new gear, so I never had any issues with the Smart Hub or Smart Plug or the Iris app. Even the lemonade was perfect.</p>
