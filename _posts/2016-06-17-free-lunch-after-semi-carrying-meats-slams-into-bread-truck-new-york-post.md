<p>But what about the mustard?</p>
<p>A tractor-trailer truck, chock-full of deli meats, crashed into another semi that was carrying bread on a New Jersey highway — making for the most delicious traffic jam in history on Friday morning.</p>
<p>Not only did the spill cause backups that stretched several exits, causing sandwich lovers on their early morning commute to stop and salivate, it also sparked a wave of hoagie-related puns and jokes on social media.</p>
<p>“They’re really sandwiched in there,” wrote Twitter user, <a href="https://twitter.com/jmfinn/status/743870473621114880">@jmfinn</a>.</p>
<p>Cameron Smith <a href="https://twitter.com/Cameron_Smith2/status/743867622106664960">tweeted</a>, “A deli meat truck crashed into a bread truck today. Citizens send their condiments for this delicious tragedy.”</p>
<p>Comedian and actor Jimmy Dunn <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmydunncomedy/status/743860992686317569">added</a>, “Governor Christie has declared a state of deliciousness.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Trucks-Carrying-Bread-Deli-Meat-Crash-on-NJ-Highway-Piscataway-383391951.html">Footage from NBC Chopper 4</a> showed first responders cleaning up the spilled bread and meats at around 7:00 a.m. as authorities assessed the scene.</p>
<p>The accident unfolded on Interstate 287’s southbound lanes in Piscataway about an hour earlier, according to the TV station.</p>
<p>There were no reports of injuries and most of the cleanup had been completed by 7:30 am.</p>
