<br><div id="start-of-content"><article class="content link-underline relative body-copy" data-js="content" itemprop="articleBody" readability="40.90780141844"><p>The violent gothic fantasy of the <em>Dark Souls</em> series has garnered a rabid fanbase in the past five years, including actor and director Eli Roth (<em>Hostel</em>), who has teamed up with the folks at Bandai Namco to put out an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCDIv2VsKJE">animated short</a> teasing <em>Dark Souls 3</em>, which comes out on April 12th. (Or now, if you <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2016/3/24/11302028/dark-souls-3-japanese-downloads-xbox-one">have an Xbox One</a> and are fine with foregoing a major patch for a little while.)</p>
<p>Along with the animators at Six Point Harness, Roth channeled his love of gruesome horror to tell a small story in <em>Dark Souls</em>‘ vast, moody world of knights, monsters, and fire. How do the noble warriors of this world turn into terrible beasts? This animated vignette, entitled “The Witches”, offers some ideas. </p>
<p>On Namco Bandai’s YouTube page, there’s also a <a href="https://youtu.be/2MdIht2tRjk">behind-the-scenes</a> feature detailing how Roth got involved with the project and how they brought his nasty vision to life. </p>
