<p>Bats: They’re not like us, in the sense that they can fly without propellers and they see with sound. Not too shabby. But in a way, they <em>are</em> a lot like us. They’re mammals, through and through, and we humans should be damn impressed by what they’ve done.</p>
<p>It’s hard to overstate just how difficult powered flight is. Sure, other mammals are “flying” about, like the <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/11/absurd-creature-of-the-week-colugo/" target="_blank">liberally-skinned colugo</a>, but they’re just gliders. Bats have not only mastered powered flight—the takeoff, the stamina of long trips, the maneuvering, the landing—but have accomplished a dexterity that puts a whole lot of birds to shame.</p>
<p>Just how they can bank and accelerate and brake so deftly was largely a mystery until recently. It was only in April that scientists announced the answer: A bat’s wings are covered in <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/04/bat-flight/" target="_blank">tiny sensory hairs</a>. These detect air currents, sending signals to the brain so a bat can juke with uncommon skill. In a way, it’s feeling its way through the air.</p>
<p>Also, I’d like to make something clear. Bats are not evil bitey things hell-bent on giving you rabies. Sure, bat to human transmission can and does happen, but bites are rare. Between 1997 and 2006 in the US, for example, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/bats/education/" target="_blank">only 17 cases of rabies in humans</a> were associated with bats. Compare that to cows, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/06/16/chart-the-animals-that-are-most-likely-to-kill-you-this-summer/" target="_blank">which kill an average of 20 people <em>a year</em></a>.</p>
<p>So let us not malign the bats, those trusty pollinators (thanks to those that feed on nectar) and bug-killers. Take a look at the video above for more fun facts about these remarkable critters. Oh, and to see the crew humiliate me. That too.</p>
<p>And I’m happy to hear from you with suggestions on what to cover next. If it’s weird and we can find footage of it, it’s fair game.
