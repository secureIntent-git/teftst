He was charged with homicide, attempted homicide and attempted homicide of deputies.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>According to the sheriff's office, at  5:29 p.m. Friday, a 7-year-old child called the 911 emergency line about a shooting at a home. Deputies found a dead 45-year-old woman by the home's driveway when they arrived. Her two children, including the 7-year-old, were alive.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The woman's identity was not released. But she and Feliciano had been in a relationship, said Captain Angelo Nieves in an interview.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>An hour later, deputies responded to a call several miles away about a shooting and found a 34-year-old man, who was later determined to be Feliciano's boss, who had been shot and wounded. The victim was taken to a local hospital, and his identity was not released.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>The Orlando Sentinel newspaper reported that Feliciano had been fired from his job earlier that day. His job and place of employment were not disclosed.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Deputies said they determined, based on a description of the suspect and vehicle, that the shooter was the same man who had shot the woman earlier.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>They tracked the suspect to a home a few blocks away, where they said he fired gun shots at them through an opening. Deputies said they returned shots. A Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) unit was called to the scene and apprehended Feliciano inside. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Feliciano was taken to a hospital for treatment of possible injuries. He was suspected of ingesting narcotics just before he was arrested, the Orlando Sentinel reported.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>"This was a very dangerous situation. One person died and a second person is still in critical condition," said Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings at a news conference after the incident.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>"The fact that he knowingly fired at law enforcement officers - this scene could have been far worst than what it was tonight."  </p><span id="midArticle_11"/><span id="midArticle_12"/><p> (Reporting by Marcus E. Howard; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)</p><span id="midArticle_13"/></div>
