<span class="focusParagraph" readability="3"><p><span class="articleLocatio&lt;/span&gt;n">A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday denied a motion to reconsider its ruling that gave a Virginia transgender high school student  access to the bathroom of his gender identity.</span></p></span><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>The Gloucester County School Board had asked the full U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals to review the decision by a three-judge panel last month in favor of Gavin Grimm, a student at the local high school.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The request was denied since none of court's 15 judges asked for a vote on the rehearing, the court said. The case has been seen as impacting the national bathroom wars between gay rights activists and social conservatives.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Grimm had filed suit after being barred from using the boys’ bathroom at his school. Grimm was born a female but identifies as a male.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>“Now that the Fourth Circuit’s decision is final, I hope my school board will finally do the right thing and let me go back to using the boys’ restroom again,” Grimm said in a statement.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The April ruling sent the widely watched case back to a lower court to re-evaluate Grimm's request for a court order. The ruling was the first by an appeals court finding protections for transgender students under the 1972 Title IX Act, which bars sex-based discrimination by schools receiving federal funding.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
