		<p>The location where a man is believed to have fallen into a hot spring at Yellowstone National Park is the site of the highest temperature ever recorded in a geothermal area of the park, a spokesperson said Wednesday.</p>

<p>The search is continuing for the man, in his 20s, after a witness reported seeing him walk off the boardwalk and into a hot spring Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Rangers are treating the incident, which occurred 225 yards off the boardwalk, as a “probable fatality,” according to a statement from the park.</p>
<p>The incident occurred at Norris Geyser Basin, a popular tourist attraction in the Wyoming park. Steamboat Geyser, the world’s tallest geyser, is in the area.</p>
<p>The basin is the hottest and oldest of the park’s many thermal hot springs and geysers. Few of the features in the basin are cooler than boiling, a park spokesperson said in an email Wednesday.</p>
<p>The highest temperature ever recorded in a geothermal area of the park — 459 degrees Fahrenheit in a drill hole 1,087 feet below the surface, <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/norrisplan.htm">according to the park’s website</a> — was at Norris Geyser Basin.</p>
<p>While the investigation continues, rangers are being extremely cautious due to the hazards of the area, according to the park’s statement.</p>
<p>The Norris basin is closed during the investigation.</p>
<p>The park planned to release more information later Wednesday.</p>
<p>The probable fatality comes are several other high-profile incidents in the park in recent weeks: a boy fell in a hot springs and was burned but rescued by his father earlier in the week; and last month, a bison calf was put down after it was rejected by the heard when man put it into an SUV, thinking it was too cold.</p>
<p>Information on safety in thermal areas and during encounters with wildlife is posted on <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/safety.htm">Yellowstone’s website</a>.</p>
