<p>Bernie Sanders <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/02/the-2016-iowa-caucuses-liveblog-bernies-got-some-buzz/" target="_blank">virtually tied</a> Hillary Clinton in Iowa. He has a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/04/politics/new-hampshire-poll-bernie-sanders-hillary-clinton/" target="_blank">serious lead in New Hampshire polls</a>. As if these weren’t enough to prove the Vermont senator is a serious contender in the 2016 presidential race, he now has another bona-fide to add to the list: an appearance on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>.</p>
<p>On Saturday, just days before Tuesday’s New Hampshire primary, Sanders took a break from campaigning to dip down to his hometown of New York City to join his doppelgänger, Larry David, on stage. And, as is often the case <a href="https://youtu.be/6Jh2n5ki0KE" target="_blank">when candidates appear on SNL</a>, Sanders’ sketch was equal parts spoof of his stump speech and a chance to deliver his stump speech to millions of viewers at once. Very clever, senator.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" readability="5.3900709219858"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Official proof that they're not the same person after all. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SNL?src=hash">#SNL</a> <a href="https://t.co/VBYPjXSGPn">pic.twitter.com/VBYPjXSGPn</a></p>
<p>— Saturday Night Live (@nbcsnl) <a href="https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/696214641458835457">February 7, 2016</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In the sketch above, Sanders plays a passenger aboard a sinking ship (the Titanic, we think?), who’s fed up with Larry David, a rich guy who’s trying to use his wealth to get a seat on the first life boat out.</p>
<p>Enter Bernie, wearing a pageboy cap and rumpled blazer.</p>
<p>“I am so sick of the 1 percent getting this preferential treatment. Enough is enough,” he says in a line surely lifted from the pages of the yellow legal pads Sanders carries with him to rallies. “We need to unite and work together if we’re all going to get through this.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like socialism to me,” David replies.</p>
<p>“Democratic socialism,” says Sanders (“Sanderswitsky,” in this sketch.)</p>
<p>“What’s the difference?” David asks?</p>
<p>“Yuuuge difference,” Sanders answers. </p>
<p>Audiences also got another taste of David’s spot-on Sanders impression in a sketch that imagines what campaigning would be like if Sanders were, well, a little more like Larry David—“Bern Your Enthusiasm.”</p>
