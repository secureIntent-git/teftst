A man blew himself up and two others were shot dead as they attacked a police station in southern Russia, local security forces said.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Two attackers were killed by officers as they tried to get into the police station in the town of Novoselitskoye in the Stavropol region, but a third succeeded in setting off an explosive device he was carrying, a spokesman for the local Interior ministry branch told ABC News.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Despite the explosion, besides the attackers no one else was hurt in the assault, the spokesman said.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Stavropol's Governor announced the region was being put on a heightened alert following the attack, with extra security being deployed to schools and hospitals, the Russian news agency, Interfax reported.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Russia’s National Counter-terrorism Committee told Interfax security forces had sealed off the area around the attack and that they were working to establish the attackers’ identities.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack but Stavropol neighbors Russia's restive North Caucasus region, where Russian security forces have been fighting a counter-insurgency against <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/lifestyle/islam-religion.htm" id="ramplink_Islamic_" target="_blank">Islamic</a> militants for around two decades. Novoselitskoye, where the attack took place, is located around 80 miles from the border with Kalbardino-Balkaria, a republic which regularly witnesses militant attacks on police.
</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
Russia has been on especially high alert for <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/terrorism.htm" id="ramplink_terrorist_" target="_blank">terrorist</a> attacks following its military intervention in Syria that began last September. In November, a Russian passenger jet was blown up over Egypt by a bomb planted by an Islamic State affiliate. The Islamic State has pledged to carry out further attacks in Russia itself.
