					<p>Happy <em>Game of Thrones</em> day everyone! So, now that we’re doing weekly narrative recaps of the HBO fantasy show, we’re going to be running our death pool odds before each new episode, instead of immediately following each episode as it airs. The idea is the same: Figuring out where a gambling man or gambling woman would put the smart money if they wanted to get rich the next time someone gets offed on <em>Game of Thrones</em>. Below are the odds for a few of the most (and least) likely characters to croak during tonight’s episode. </p>

The whole “I’m unburnt, watch me torch this khal meeting” thing is cute, but the Dothraki plunder <em>for a living</em> and when they saw her walk out of those flames they still straight-up genuflected.
