<br><div id="start-of-content"><p>You may not have heard of <a href="http://www.meizu.com/en/" target="_blank">Meizu</a> yet, but you’ll be hearing a lot about it soon. At least, that’s what the company hopes. It’s already one of China’s biggest smartphone players, the company’s worth more than $3 billion (making it… a tricorn?), and it’s now trying to make a name for itself in the US. Meizu is not trying to crack the States with phones, though. That’s too much work here. Meizu’s first US product is Gravity, a cantilevered wireless speaker with an eye-catching display.</p>

</p>
The speaker itself is more like a Jambox or Beats Pill than the giant bookshelf Polk system in your parents’ den. It connects to your phone via Wi-Fi and a companion app, or to any other device with Bluetooth or an AUX port. Meizu says lots of good and technical things about the sound, but everybody says those things. More than anything, Gravity is just cool-looking, in a way few speakers ever are. It’s the sort of homey-future device you’d find in Theodore Twombly’s house in <em>Her</em>. It’s like you stuck an ice block through a soundbar; the clear stand makes the speaker look like it’s floating in mid-air. The asymmetrical design makes it look both bigger and somehow more dramatic than it is. Rather than simply point the device’s display in your direction, the Gravity reflects it through a prism, so the image appears to just be painted on the glass. The Gravity was designed by Japanese designer Hironao Tsuboi, whose products are always minimalist and unadorned. Meizu calls it “missing design:” Most speakers loudly proclaim themselves, with bold colors and crazy patterns, but Meizu wants Gravity to be invisible. It’s not, of course. It’s a speaker. But it’s a nice idea.
<h3>New Company Who Dis?</h3>
<p>Meizu has a long history of audio products. It started as an MP3 player company: its <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000GJE88A/?tag=w050b-20">M6 Mini</a> was like the iPod Nano, minus all the Apple restrictions. Even its smartphones have always been known for their sound quality. The company’s both big and experienced enough that it doesn’t need Kickstarter or Indiegogo to sell its products, but it’s still crowdfunding the new speaker. The Indiegogo campaign is purely a marketing ploy, meant to engage a small number of fans in a new market who might feel more connected to Meizu than if they’d just tossed the speaker into their Target cart. </p>
<p>When it does come out, the Gravity will cost $199, which puts it right in line with most other high-end wireless speakers. If people like it, expect to hear a lot more from Meizu soon. Actually, you can expect that either way. You don’t get to be a tricorn without having some global ambitions.</p>
