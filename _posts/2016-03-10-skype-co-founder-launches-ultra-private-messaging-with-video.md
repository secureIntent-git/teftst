<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="7"><p><span class="articleLocation">FRANKFURT</span> A group of former Skype technologists, backed by the co-founder of the messaging platform, has introduced a new version of its own messaging service that promises end-to-end encryption for all conversations, including by video.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Wire, a 50-person start-up mostly made up of engineers, is stepping into a global political debate over encryption that pits privacy against security advocates, epitomized by the standoff between the U.S. government and Apple.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The company said on Thursday it was adding video calling to a package of private communications services that go beyond existing messaging providers.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Rivals such as Facebook's (<span id="symbol_FB.O_0">FB.O</span>) Messenger and WhatsApp, Telegram, Threema and Signal offer encryption on only parts of a message's journey or for a limited set of services, it said.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Wire, which is based in Switzerland and stores user communications on its own computers, delivers privacy protections that are always on, even when callers use multiple devices, such as a phone or desktop PC simultaneously. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>This comprehensive approach poses fresh challenges to law enforcers, who often seek to exploit gaps in encryption in  criminal or security investigations.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>"We believe Wire is unique in the industry with always-on encryption for all conversation(s), in groups or 1:1, with simultaneous support for multiple devices," Wire Chief Technology Officer Alan Duric said in a statement.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>"Everything is end-to-end encrypted: That means voice and video calls, texts, pictures, graphics - all the content you can send," Wire Executive Chairman Janus Friis told Reuters.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The Danish entrepreneur was a co-founder of Skype, first released in 2003, which was later sold to a series of owners and is now a unit of Microsoft Corp (<span id="symbol_MSFT.O_1">MSFT.O</span>).</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Wire launched the first version of its self-titled communications app late in 2014 to limited notice because it offered encrypted calling and text services similar to a dozen other apps, distinguished mainly by crystal-clear voice quality. </p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>The app relies on standard, open-source encryption techniques, which allows outside technical experts to evaluate the security of its products rather than relying on trust.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Technical details can be found at <a href="https://wire.com/privacy/">wire.com/privacy/</a></p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Wire receives financial backing from Iconical, a group of designers, engineers and executives that act as alternative to traditional venture capital investors. Friis invests in Wire as part of Iconical.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>It has not disclosed how much funding it has received. A key selling point for Wire is that it protects users from advertising. Like many start-ups in this area, it is seeking to grow quickly and discover a sustainable business model later.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><span id="midArticle_15"/><p> (Editing by Mark Potter)</p><span id="midArticle_16"/></div>
