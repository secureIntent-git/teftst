Couch was 16 at the time of the fatal accident, so the case is being handled for now in juvenile court.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:apcm="http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm" xmlns:apnm="http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm" xmlns:o="http://w3.org/ns/odrl/2/">"He's certainly capable of understanding now what's going on, and I'd feel better if he was there," Anderson said.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:apcm="http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm" xmlns:apnm="http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm" xmlns:o="http://w3.org/ns/odrl/2/">During the sentencing phase of the 2013 trial, a defense witness argued Couch had been coddled into a sense of irresponsibility by his wealthy parents.

They were apprehended in the Mexican resort city of Puerto Vallarta on Dec. 28, after a call for pizza delivery tipped off authorities to their whereabouts.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:apcm="http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm" xmlns:apnm="http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm" xmlns:o="http://w3.org/ns/odrl/2/">Couch initially fought deportation, but he dropped the fight this week.

If he were to violate his probation again, he could get up to 10 years in prison for each of the four people killed in the drunken-driving wreck.</p><p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:apcm="http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm" xmlns:apnm="http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm" xmlns:o="http://w3.org/ns/odrl/2/">If his case remains in juvenile court, he could be held in a juvenile detention center for violating his probation until he turns 19 in April, at which point he would become eligible for parole.</p>
