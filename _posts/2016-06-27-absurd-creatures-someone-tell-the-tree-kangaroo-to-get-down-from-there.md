<p>Nine out of 10 historians agree: Vlad the Impaler was a bad person, largely because there are several less cruel ways to dispatch your enemies. But for a bird called the kingfisher, impalement is a way of life. Hovering above rivers, it’ll spot a fish, dive into the water, and skewer its prey. And that’s pretty damn impressive, considering that because light bends when it hits water, the kingfisher has to correct its course on the wing. Find out more about Kingfisher the Impaler in this week’s episode of <em>Absurd Creatures</em>!</p>
<p><em>And I’m happy to hear from you with suggestions on what to cover next. If it’s weird and we can find footage of it, it’s fair game. You can get me at matthew_simon@wired.com or on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/mrmattsimon" target="_blank">@mrMattSimon</a>.</em></p>
