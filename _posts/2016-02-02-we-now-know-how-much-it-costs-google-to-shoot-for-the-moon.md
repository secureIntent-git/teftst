<br><div id="start-of-content"><article class="content link-underline relative body-copy border-b pad-b-50" data-js="content" itemprop="articleBody" readability="70.210650887574"><p>For the first time in its existence, Google—or technically, its parent company, Alphabet—posted quarterly results with its earnings cleaved into two. There’s the main Google Internet businesses, which includes search and advertising operations; and its riskier moonshots, its so-called “other bets.” Now, also for the first time, we know how much it costs Google to shoot for the moon.</p>
<p>According to the company’s latest earnings report, Alphabet’s forays into health technology, self-driving cars and delivery drones, among other moonshots, lost the company $3.6 billion last year, compared to $1.9 billion in 2014. But those same efforts did generate more revenue this year for a total of $448 million, a 37 percent increase from 2014.</p>
<p>That may sound expensive. But we also finally got a glimpse into how well Google’s core Internet businesses are doing—and it’s doing very well, indeed. Search, advertising, YouTube and Android, among others, brought in $74.5 billion in revenue compared to $65.7 billion last year—a 13.5 percent gain. Yearly operating income raked in $23.4 billion, rising 23 percent from $19.01 billion one year ago.</p>
<p>The company is also showing evidence of increased spending discipline under Alphabet’s Wall Street-trained CFO, Ruth Porat. Capital expenditures shrank to $2.1 billion in the last three months of 2015, compared to $3.55 billion a year earlier. Net income for the fourth quarter, meanwhile, rose $4.92 billion from $4.68 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>Finally, Alphabet revealed this afternoon that it has $73 billion cash on hand—enough to keep funding its moonshots for years to come.</p>
