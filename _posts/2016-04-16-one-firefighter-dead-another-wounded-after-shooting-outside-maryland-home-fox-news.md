                <p>One firefighter was killed and another firefighter was in serious condition Friday night after being shot while making a welfare check at a Maryland home, officials said.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>Prince George’s County Police Department spokeswoman Julie Parker identified the deceased fireman as John Ulmshneider, 39. She said Ulmshneider was a 13-year veteran of the department.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>Department officials said in a statement that volunteer firefighter Kevin Swain also was shot, and was in serious condition.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>Swain suffered multiple wounds to the body and was flown by helicopter to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore, Prince County George’s County Fire and EMS spokesman said, according to <a href="http://www.fox5dc.com/news/local-news/123409430-story" target="_blank">WTTG-TV</a>.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>Prince George’s County Police Chief Henry P. Stawinski III said at a news conference that firefighters and police had gone to the Temple Hills home after being called by a person concerned the individual inside might be suffering from a medical condition.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>When the firefighters arrived at the house, the person inside was unresponsive. The firefighters decided to force their way inside and were met with gunfire. A person inside fired several rounds, striking two firefighters and the person who had initially made the call for a welfare check.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>Stawinski said that once officers got into the home, the gunfire stopped. He said no officers fired weapons.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>"Will it ever end? God, I hope so," Stawinski said.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>Deputy Fire Chief Benjamin Barksdale said earlier Friday that both firefighters were both critically injured, and one was flown to a trauma center.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>The civilian was not seriously injured, according to the police chief.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>The person who was inside the home was in custody and cooperating with police, Stawinski said.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>The identity of the person inside the home was not immediately available.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>"The main thing that we ask for the men and women of Prince George's County are your prayers, your thoughts," said Prince George's County Executive Rushern Baker.</p>
