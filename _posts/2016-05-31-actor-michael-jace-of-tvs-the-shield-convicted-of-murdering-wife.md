The couple's sons, ages 8 and 5 at the time, watched the killing in the family's South Los Angeles home, prosecutors said. She was 40 years old when she was slain.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Prosecutors had asked jurors to find Jace guilty of first-degree murder, which involves premeditation, Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office spokesman Greg Risling said. But the jury in Los Angeles Superior Court instead found Jace guilty of second-degree murder, an intentional killing that was not premeditated. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Jace's attorneys acknowledged in court that he shot his wife. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>"Our entire goal was to show this was not a case of premeditation, and we achieved that goal," Jace's attorney, Jamon Hicks, said in an email. "This was a very smart and intelligent jury who deliberated and considered the evidence. They were not just moved by emotion but by the evidence."</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The jury of six women and six men began deliberations late on Friday and resumed on Tuesday morning, spending two hours considering the case before reaching the verdict, prosecutors said. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>The jury found Jace used a handgun in the crime, a special circumstance that increases his minimum prison time by 25 years beyond the minimum term for second-degree murder, Risling said.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Jace is best known for portraying police officer Julien Lowe, a religious Christian conflicted about his homosexuality, on the FX cable drama "The Shield" that ran from 2002 to 2008.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Aside from "The Shield," Jace had small parts in the films "Forrest Gump," "Boogie Nights" and "Planet of the Apes" as well as various supporting roles on television in the past two decades. He filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 2011.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><span id="midArticle_12"/><p> (Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Will Dunham)</p><span id="midArticle_13"/></div>
