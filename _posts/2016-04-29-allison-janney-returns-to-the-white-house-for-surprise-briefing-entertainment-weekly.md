    <p>TV’s favorite White House Press Secretary was back at the White House podium Friday when Allison Janney made a surprise appearance.</p>
<p>Janney, who starred as C.J. Cregg for seven seasons on <em>The West Wing</em>, shocked the press core when she walked into the Press Briefing Room instead of current Press Secretary Josh Earnest. Janney said that Earnest was having a root canal, a callback to an episode in the first season of <em>The West Wing</em>, in which C.J. had a root canal that led to a disastrous press conference conducted by Josh (Bradley Whitford). </p>
<p>Earnest did show up to reveal that the <em>Mom</em> star was there to discuss the opioid epidemic and to support those who help people dealing with substance abuse. Janney, whose character on <em>Mom</em> is a recovering addict, honored the White House Champions of Change, a group of individuals who are recognized for their work with substance abuse issues.</p>

<p>Janney did take one question when a reporter asked who President Bartlett (Martin Sheen) was supporting for the Democratic nomination. In typical C.J. fashion she replied, “I think you know the answer to that question.”</p>
