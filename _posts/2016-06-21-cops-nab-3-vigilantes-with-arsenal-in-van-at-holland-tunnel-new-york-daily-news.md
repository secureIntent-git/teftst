	Cops arrested three “self-styled vigilantes” with loaded handguns, rifles, 2,000 rounds of ammunition, a gun clip that says “America,” and bullet-resistant vests with the word “Police” written on them at the Holland Tunnel early Tuesday, police and sources said.</p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	The trio was stopped on the New Jersey toll plaza for the tunnel at about 7:40 a.m. for driving a vividly colored red, black and green Dodge pickup with a cracked windshield, police said. </p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	When a Port Authority Police officer looked into a window, he saw the magazine for a gun.</p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	An ensuing search turned up five pistols, two rifles (including a shotgun and what resembles an assault rifle), four knives, 10 loaded clips of ammunition, and a military-grade helmet. All the guns were “locked and loaded,” a source said.</p>     <p> <a class="ra-related" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/pa-man-arrested-driving-holland-tunnel-guns-ammo-article-1.2590640">Pa. man arrested driving near Holland Tunnel with guns, ammo</a> </p>     &#13;
<p>&#13;
	Some of the guns were found hidden in a passenger compartment. One of the clips had “United We Stand” written on it, and another had “America” on it.</p>                                                                                <div class="ra-module h" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemid="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Cops-nab-3-vigilantes-with-arsenal-in-van-at-Holland-Tunnel-New-York-Daily-News.jpg">

	Police also found drug paraphernalia in the car, and believe all three suspects are heavy heroin users, sources said. They may have been coming to Queens to rescue a woman, also involved with heroin, who was being held against her will, sources said.</p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	“They may be self-styled vigilantes,” a source said.</p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	The trio’s gaudily painted pickup was equipped with special lights and a front-end carrier containing a lime green cooler. </p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	The name of an Emmaus, Penn. gun store called Higher Ground Tactical was also written several times on the pickup. A man who answered the phone at the gun store declined to comment on the incident.</p>                 <!-- HTML Element: 7.2619462 -->                 &#13;
<p>&#13;
	“I don’t know what happened,” he said.</p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	Two men in their 50’s, and a woman in her 20’s were arrested, police said. All three are white, sources said.</p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	They were coming from Pennsylvania, police said. Charges are pending.</p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	A Port Authority police spokesman described the officer’s initiative in stopping the car as “astute.”</p>                                                                                  <div class="ra-module h" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemid="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/1466536508_314_Cops-nab-3-vigilantes-with-arsenal-in-van-at-Holland-Tunnel-New-York-Daily-News.jpg">

	“The agency does not believe the incident is terrorism-related,” the spokesman said.</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	NYPD Counter-Terrorism tweeted Tuesday that they are monitoring the situation.</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	It was not immediately clear whether the guns were licensed in Pennsylvania.</p>                    <dl id="ra-tags"><dt>Tags:</dt>  <dd> <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/tags/gun-violence">gun violence</a> </dd>  <dd> <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/tags/pennsylvania">pennsylvania</a> </dd>  <dd> <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/tags/new-jersey">new jersey</a> </dd>  </dl><a href="mailto:voicers@nydailynews.com?subject=Cops nab 3 'vigilantes' with arsenal in van at Holland Tunnel&amp;body=To%20submit%20a%20comment%20about%20this%20article%20for%20publication%20in%20the%20Daily%20News%20Voice%20of%20the%20People%20column,%20please%20include%20your%20name,%20your%20city%20and%20state%20and%20your%20phone%20number.%20(Please%20include%20your%20borough%20or%20neighborhood%20if%20you%20live%20in%20NYC.%20Phone%20number%20is%20for%20verification%20purposes%20only,%20not%20for%20publication.)%20The%20Daily%20News%20reserves%20the%20right%20to%20edit%20letters. %0A%0A http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/cops-arrest-3-people-loaded-handguns-holland-tunnel-article-1.2682095" class="ra-editor">Send a Letter to the Editor</a>  <dl id="ra-share-bottom"><dt>Join the Conversation:</dt> <dd class="ra-share-f"> <a target="_blank" href="#">facebook</a> </dd> <dd class="ra-share-t"> <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Cops nab 3 'vigilantes' with arsenal in van at Holland Tunnel&amp;url=http://nydn.us/28MGMLc">Tweet</a> </dd> </dl></div>
