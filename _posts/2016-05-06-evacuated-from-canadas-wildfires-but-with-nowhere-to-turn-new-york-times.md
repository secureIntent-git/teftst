As the fire expanded and shifted south, they were forced to again pack up and find refuge.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="186" data-total-count="3008">By Thursday, officials believed that the vast majority had made their way to Edmonton, the nearest major city, or farther south to Calgary, the home of white-collar oil industry workers.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="314" data-total-count="3322">About 2,800 people without friends or family in Edmonton ended up registering at the Northlands Exhibition Center, now an emergency shelter, including Justin Dick, 23, who was lured to Fort McMurray three years ago along with his mother and stepfather, from Winnipeg, Manitoba, by hopes of sharing in the oil boom.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="132" data-total-count="3454">Now, Mr. Dick said outside the exhibition hall, it looked as if the house where he lived and all their belongings had been consumed.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="83" data-total-count="3537">“We just wanted to get ahead in life and now we’ve lost everything,” he said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="178" data-total-count="3715">A few yards away, Malcolm MacQueen, 31, a fire extinguisher technician from Fort McMurray, said that he was already looking for another job just hours after arriving in Edmonton.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

Dogs and children sat around the lobby as their anxious parents tried to figure out how to move forward. In the restaurant on Wednesday night, a group of employees of Suncor, a Canadian energy company, watched television news reports about the fire and checked Twitter. Ryan Whitmarsh, 28, an engineer, said he happened to sleep late on Tuesday morning, missed a company shuttle and for that reason took his car to work. His inadvertent tardiness proved to be a boon a few hours later when everyone was told to evacuate immediately.</p><figure id="media-100000004388627" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000004388627 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/06/world/CANADA2/CANADA2-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group"><span class="visually-hidden">Photo</span>

The highway to Edmonton was so jammed that they camped on the road on Tuesday night, waking up to spot good Samaritans offering free gasoline to stranded motorists. While Ryan Whitmarsh and his father are safe, worries about his $427,000 house torment him. “I have a knot in my stomach just thinking about it,” he said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="288" data-total-count="5360">Though most residents cling to the faint hope that their homes and belongings have survived, some are less optimistic. Asked what she expected to find upon returning to her condominium, Mona Wesala, 27, a Kenyan engineer who works for Suncor, slowly shook her head. “Ashes,” she said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="400" data-total-count="5760">Not all evacuees had flights to safety. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported that thousands of cars were lined up behind a blockade north of Fort McMurray on Thursday. As frustration mounted, the broadcaster reported, more than two dozen cars and trucks tried to force their way through police cars acting barriers but stopped when at least one police officer stood in front of his cruiser.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="629" data-total-count="6389">What will replace the ashes of Fort McMurray and what to do with the displaced remained questions for the future on Thursday. While temperatures that were unusually warm even for midsummer were replaced by more seasonable conditions on Thursday, the fire showed no obvious signs that it was abating. Fire officials told reporters that without significant rainfall, it could remain out of control and continue growing for several more days. Aerial bombers were covering the building still standing in Fort McMurray with water and flame retardants. But officials said those measures would not guarantee the buildings’ protection.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="421" data-total-count="6810">Fort McMurray has loomed large in the collective imagination of Canada. To environmentalists, its name is synonymous with degradation. Others view the oil sands a major technological achievement. And many Canadians, without ever visiting, imagined an out-of-control boom town rampant with crime and social problems. Both, along with eye-popping real estate prices, exist but became inflated in retellings beyond the city.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="315" data-total-count="7125">Ms. Curnew, like a disproportionate number of Fort McMurray residents, came from Newfoundland, a province of chronic unemployment 22 years ago to build a new life. She has no connections or family elsewhere in Alberta, and likely nothing to return to in Fort McMurray. But she hopes to stay in her adopted province.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="163" data-total-count="7288">While she said that she has encountered nothing but kindness since Tuesday, Ms. Curnew is disturbed about much of what she sees on social media about her hometown.</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

I’m not materialistic, I was just there living within my means just trying to raise my son.”</p><a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#whats-next">Continue reading the main story</a>
