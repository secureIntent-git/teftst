        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Although Redstone had to be asked some questions more than once, and had an interpreter to help understand his answers, the billionaire appeared to settle some of the central questions at issue in the trial. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>After seeing Redstone’s videotaped deposition, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David Cowan told Herzer's lawyer: “He has told me now best he can what he wants.
