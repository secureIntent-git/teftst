<br><div id=""><p>Like much of the market, tech stocks are <a href="http://money.cnn.com/data/markets/nasdaq/" target="_blank">getting slaughtered</a>. Since the beginning of the year, investors have been selling off their shares in some of tech’s most chattered-about names as anxieties about the global economy rise.</p>
<p>But some companies are going to have a harder time rebounding than others.</p>
<p>The so-called FANG stocks—Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and Google—have all taken their lumps in recent weeks. But chances are that, even after the S&amp;P 500 ended the day at its <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/01/20/us-markets.html" target="_blank">lowest level since 2014</a>, shares in these powerful, growing companies will prove resilient.</p>
<p data-js="fader" class="pullquote carve fader">
	'It's been a bloodbath since the ball dropped on New Year's Eve.'	<span class="attribution">Daniel Ives, FBR Capital Markets</span>
</p>

<p>It’s a different crop of tech stocks—the BEGgars and MisFiTS?—that’s looking pretty grim. Shares in <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=box+stock" target="_blank">Box</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=etsy+stock" target="_blank">Etsy</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=gopro+stock" target="_blank">GoPro</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=match+stock" target="_blank">Match</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=fitbit+stock" target="_blank">Fitbit</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=twitter+stock" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=square+stock" target="_blank">Square</a> were all trading below their initial public offering price today. Those companies have each struggled in their own ways in the past year, even without the added pressure of an overall market decline.</p>
<p>In an environment where that pressure is very real, staging a comeback in the market will be even harder for these companies. Their only chance may be to show, quickly, that their businesses can grow and thrive in an uncertain climate. Amid general uncertainty, investors seem less likely to show patience while young tech companies try to prove their worth.</p>
<p>“It’s been a bloodbath since the ball dropped on New Year’s Eve,” says Daniel Ives, senior analyst for technology, media, and telecom research at FBR Capital Markets. “There’s a lot of fear out there in terms of the overall growth in the consumer and enterprise tech space.”</p>
<h3>‘One Trick Monkeys’</h3>
<p>When it comes to tech stocks, Ives says there are real worries over what he calls “the one trick monkeys.” <span>GoPro, which hasn’t been able to deliver on <a href="http://variety.com/2014/digital/news/gopro-sees-future-as-content-company-1201172433/" target="_blank">its content business</a>, recently announced <a href="http://fortune.com/2016/01/13/gopro-layoffs-weak-sales/" target="_blank">weak sales and employee layoffs</a>. Fitbit, meanwhile, is facing stiff competition from Apple’s Watch. Twitter remains unable to significantly grow its domestic user base compared to Facebook. “The bloom’s come off the rose for a lot of these,” Ives says.</span></p>
<p>As FANG stocks soared, some of that excitement brushed off on the tech sector as a whole.</p>
<p>“<span class="s1">These stocks were bid up on the wave of this excitement, and any weakness was seen as a buying opportunity in a rising market,” says <span>Patrick Spencer, managing director and vice president of equities at Robert W. Baird, says.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="s1"><span> </span></span><span class="s1">“When the market turned south recently people became very selective … sold the losers and kept the winners,” he adds. And he says even the winners—that is, the FANGs—are being sold, too.</span></p>
<h3>A Reckoning</h3>
<p>So what could change investors’ minds? For one thing, proof that the companies are, in fact, doing well or even better than expected. “I think tech earnings will be more of a positive catalyst,” Ives says, adding that the lack of news combined with the negative atmosphere has had an “avalanche effect.”</p>
<p>“I expect we’ll see choppy earnings, but the bark’s worse than the bite.”</p>
<p>The FANG stocks, after all, won’t continue to drop forever. “Good quality growth stocks will stabilize and start to rise again,” Spencer says. “Tech stocks perform well over the long term as long as they have rising earnings—that is the key. Those that don’t will fall by the wayside and underperform.”</p>
<p>And those underperformers will likely mean fewer tech stocks on the market by the end of 2016. “We’re particularly watching Fitbit, GoPro, and Box as three potential clear acquisition candidates,” Ives says. “It’s a white-knuckle period for tech. Put on your seatbelt.”</p>
