<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">LOUISVILLE, Ky.</span> Fans chanting "Ali!" and throwing flowers lined the streets of Muhammad Ali's hometown in Kentucky on Friday for a funeral procession to celebrate the boxing champion who jolted America with his showmanship and won worldwide admiration as a man of principle.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Ali, a once-controversial convert to Islam who lost three years of his boxing career for refusing U.S. military service during the Vietnam War, died a week ago at age 74 as one of the most respected men in the United States.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Mourners traveled from across the United States and  overseas to the city of Louisville to pay tribute to Ali. Many tossed flowers atop the hearse carrying his casket as part of an 18-car procession over 23 miles (37 km) in a farewell unlike any other in recent U.S. history.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Thousands gathered in the streets and large crowds amassed at landmarks along the route such as his boyhood home in a traditionally African-American section of town and the Muhammad Ali Center, a museum in the city center.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The procession was to end at a cemetery for a private burial beneath a headstone reading simply, "Ali." </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>"It was important for me to be here," said Matt Alexander, 63, who traveled from Florida. "I cried like a baby when I heard he'd died. I just didn't want to believe it because I wanted him to live forever."</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>After the procession, thousands of people were expected to fill a sports arena for a memorial featuring eulogies by former U.S. President Bill Clinton and comedian Billy Crystal. Police said crowding along the procession route would delay the start of the memorial service, possibly by an hour to 3 p.m.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Jordan's King Abdullah had been announced as one of the dignitaries due to attend the sports arena for the service. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who attended a Muslim funeral for Ali on Thursday, cut short his visit to Louisville and will not take part in Friday's event as planned.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Pallbearers will include actor Will Smith, who earned an Oscar nomination for playing the title role in the 2001 film "Ali," and former heavyweight champs Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>"HE STOOD UP"</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Fans such as Cathy Oost, 61, a retired public school teacher who lives in Louisville, was one of several hundred people to gather under blue skies at the cemetery gates to pay their respects. She held a sign that read "Our Champ, Our Hero."</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Oost said she was struck by Ali's speaking out for racial equality and his stance against the Vietnam War, plus his defense of Islam. Ali, a three-time world heavyweight champion, also paved the way for black athletes to express themselves with flair and confidence, and gave U.S. Muslims a hero they could share with mainstream America.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>"He stood up for his beliefs when it was unpopular and difficult to do so. We all need to do that more," Oost said.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Bridget McKay, 45, also at the cemetery gates, said she felt drawn to witness history.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>"He made me feel that it was OK to be myself, that I didn't have to be anyone else," she said.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>After years of restoration to convert his childhood home into a museum, developers finally held a grand opening on May 1.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/>

"He didn't start in a gym. He didn't start as Muhammad Ali. He started in this house right here."</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Willie B. Palmer, 75, said he graduated high school with Ali, who was training for the Olympics when he graduated Central High School in 1960.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Ali would train by jogging the bus route to the school.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>"Sometimes he'd be there before the bus," Palmer said.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><span id="midArticle_8"/><p> (Reporting by Steve Bittenbender; Writing by Daniel Trotta; Editing by Bill Trott)</p><span id="midArticle_9"/></div>
