<p><em>God of War</em> is back, and it’s beardy. And now with more kids!</p>
<p>Announced at the Sony E3 press conference on Monday, a new <em>God of War</em> for PlayStation 4 shows an older, dadified murder man who looks a lot like Kratos fighting supernatural monsters in a Norse-inspired frozen wilderness while also, uh, teaching his son how to hunt. Hey, everybody’s gotta do something in retirement. </p>
<p>A brief gameplay demonstration showed everything you’d expect to see from the series, which has up until now featured the Spartan warrior Kratos killing just about everything in the Greek pantheon. But it also showed an open-world take on the series, with the main character earning experience points for discovering new locations, building up his skill in archery, et cetera. It’s a reinvented <em>God of War</em> in almost every way. No release date was announced.</p>
