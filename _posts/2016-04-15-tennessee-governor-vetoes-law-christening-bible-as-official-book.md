That vote followed the state House's approval last year.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Haslam, who won re-election in 2014, faced mounting pressure from civil libertarian and non-theistic groups to stop the measure from becoming law.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Hedy Weinberg, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee, praised the decision, saying elected officials should not "use their official positions to favor one religious belief over another."</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
