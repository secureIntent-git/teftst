<br><div id=""><p> <span class="dateline">VIENNA —</span> Iran will release Washington Post correspondent Jason Rezaian and three other detained Iranian Americans on Saturday in exchange for at least six people imprisoned or charged in the United States, Iranian officials said, a swap linked to the imminent implementation of a landmark nuclear deal between Tehran and six world powers.</p> <p>Iranian officials said Rezaian, 39, was freed from Tehran’s notorious Evin Prison after 18 months of captivity and was to be promptly flown out of the country with the three other released detainees. </p> <p>Iran’s judiciary <a href="http://en.farsnews.com/newstext.aspx?nn=13941026001314">announced the release</a> in Tehran as part of an exchange, according to Iranian news media. </p> <p>In return, the United States was scheduled to release at least six people charged with violating sanctions against Iran, the Iranians said. </p> <p>There was no immediate official confirmation of the deal from the U.S. side.</p><div class="inline-content inline-photo-left" style="width:300px;"> <a name="9b30bc034c7f63e74ec02d7b6604cfd89941fc89"/> <img alt="" src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Iran-to-free-Post-correspondent-Jason-Rezaian-3-others-Iranian-reports-say-Washington-Post.JPE"/><span class="pb-caption">A Dec. 27, 2011 file photo of a video frame grab image made from the Iranian broadcaster IRIB TV, shows U.S. citizen Amir Mirzaei Hekmati, accused by Iran of spying for the CIA, in Tehran's revolutionary court, in Iran.

He said he was told that his three clients, who have been charged with sanctions violations but have not yet gone to trial, have been issued a pardon by President Obama. The administration had no immediate comment.</p> <p>Kris Coratti, vice president of communications and spokeswoman for The Post, said that “while we are hopeful, we have not received any official word of Jason’s release.”</p> <p>The journalist’s ordeal damaged his health, drew protests from media and human rights groups and hampered efforts to improve relations between Washington and Tehran. It also exposed fault lines and infighting in Iran’s opaque political system, where Rezaian and other detained Americans appeared to become pawns in a larger internal struggle between hard-liners and reformists seeking to improve ties with the West.</p> <p>Kerry frequently raised the plight of Rezaian and other imprisoned U.S. citizens during last year’s nuclear negotiations, but their release was not part of the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/historic-nuclear-deal-with-iran-expected-to-be-announced/2015/07/14/5f8dddb2-29ea-11e5-a5ea-cf74396e59ec_story.html">resulting agreement</a> between Iran and the six world powers: the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany.</p> <p channel="wp.com" class="interstitial-link"> <i>[<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/stories-jason-rezaian/">Post coverage of Americans detained in Iran</a>]</i> </p> <p>Rezaian was tried last year behind closed doors on vague charges of espionage and other alleged offenses and was sentenced to an unspecified prison term.</p> <p>The Americans’ release came as the International Atomic Energy Agency prepared to certify Iran’s compliance with the nuclear deal, triggering steps to lift U.N. sanctions against the country and return an estimated $50 billion in frozen Iranian funds. (Tens of billions more in frozen funds are to be used to pay Iranian debts.)</p> <p>Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has hailed the nuclear accord’s “Implementation Day” and its promise of sanctions relief as heralding a “year of economic prosperity” for Iran and fulfillment of his campaign promises when he was elected in 2013.</p> <p>Rezaian’s 2014 arrest and his subsequent trial and conviction in Iran’s secretive Revolutionary Court system — on charges that were never publicly disclosed or substantiated — appeared to reflect a power play by hard-liners fiercely loyal to Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, against more moderate reformist elements under Rouhani. The hard-liners control Iran’s security forces, intelligence apparatus, judiciary and most other levers of power, while Rouhani — though answerable to Khamenei — has been given relatively free rein to manage Iran’s foreign affairs and improve its economy.</p> <p>Although major differences between Tehran and Washington persist, tensions eased somewhat after the nuclear deal was reached in July. It imposed restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program, aimed at forestalling any attempt to build nuclear weapons, in return for the lifting of international economic sanctions on Iran and the release of frozen Iranian funds from banks worldwide, mostly in Asia.</p> <p>Iran in recent weeks took significant steps to meet its obligations under the deal in anticipation of securing sanctions relief and regaining access to its impounded cash. Such tangible benefits from the nuclear accord, which was opposed by hard-liners, could help moderates in Iran’s legislative elections at the end of February.</p> <p>Increased U.S.-Iranian cooperation appeared to be on display Wednesday when <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/01/13/intense-diplomacy-between-secretary-of-state-kerry-and-his-iranian-counterpart-to-secure-sailors-release/?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_no-name%3Ahomepage%2Fstory">Iran released 10 U.S. sailors</a> within a day after they were seized by Iranian Revolutionary Guard naval forces in the Persian Gulf. The Americans were on two small riverine boats that strayed into Iranian waters. </p> <p>Against this backdrop, the signs of rapprochement raised hopes for a resolution in Rezaian’s case. </p> <p>For the first time, the Revolutionary Court allowed his mother, Mary Rezaian, and his Iranian wife, Yeganeh Salehi, to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/jailed-washington-post-correspondent-has-christmas-meal-with-family/2015/12/25/dacdb3ac-ab2d-11e5-bff5-905b92f5f94b_story.html">visit him in Evin Prison</a> for an extended period on Christmas Day. In an email to The Washington Post, Mary Rezaian said the meeting lasted “several hours” and that she was able to bring her son “his first home-cooked meal in months.” </p> <p>Dec. 3 marked the Post correspondent’s 500th day in captivity — longer than 52 Americans were held during the 1979-81 Iran hostage crisis and by far the lengthiest detention of a Western journalist by Tehran.</p> <p channel="wp.com" class="interstitial-link"> <i>[<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/washington-post-seeks-un-help-in-freeing-journalist-held-by-iran/2015/07/21/524081c4-2f20-11e5-8f36-18d1d501920d_story.html?hpid=z1">The Post petitions U.N. to help free Jason Rezaian</a>]</i> </p> <p>Ahead of that milestone, The Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/post-reporter-at-grimmest-milestone-500-days-in-iranian-detention/2015/12/02/4bc2c542-98e2-11e5-b499-76cbec161973_story.html">filed a supplementary petition</a> with the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, amplifying a filing in July that accused Iran of flagrant human rights violations during Rezaian’s “unlawful” detention and called for his immediate release. </p> <p> The additional petition cited the journalist’s “declining health,” saying he continued to lose weight and suffer from blood pressure complications and other undertreated physical and mental conditions. It said he was subjected to “further interrogations, psychological abuse, and physical mistreatment” and was “forced to wear a hood” when being escorted around the prison by guards or interrogators.</p> <p> Born in Marin County, Calif., to an Iranian emigre father and an American mother, Rezaian moved to Iran in 2008 and worked as a journalist for publications including the San Francisco Chronicle. He joined The Post in 2012 and wrote stories that he hoped would give readers a deeper and more nuanced view of Iran; one of his last recounted the travails of the country’s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/baseball-in-iran-is-more-like-the-bad-news-bears-than-the-major-leagues/2014/07/16/767f8752-3ea8-4b96-9198-e44136771a25_story.html">fledgling baseball team</a>.</p> <p> Rezaian was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/iran-confirms-arrest-of-post-correspondent/2014/07/25/54fdbc9c-13f6-11e4-8936-26932bcfd6ed_story.html">arrested along with his wife</a> when security forces raided their home on July 22, 2014.

The case was assigned to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/hard-liner-judge-assigned-case-of-post-reporter-jason-rezaian-jailed-in-iran/2015/02/01/5f21de04-a8c2-11e4-a06b-9df2002b86a0_story.html" title="www.washingtonpost.com">Abolghassem Salavati</a>, a hard-line judge known for imposing draconian sentences — including long prison terms, lashings and execution — on political prisoners and detainees deemed a threat to national security.

But Iran, which does not recognize dual nationality, barred any U.S. role in the case, including consular visits by Swiss diplomats representing U.S. interests. Diplomatic relations between Washington and Tehran were severed in 1980 during the Iranian hostage crisis.</p> <p>The last of four Revolutionary Court sessions was held in August, but it was not until October that a court spokesman announced a conviction — without providing any details. In November, the court said Rezaian was sentenced to a prison term, again with no elaboration.</p> <p>In the meantime, Iranian officials floated the idea of a prisoner swap with the United States. President Rouhani even suggested that Tehran could free Rezaian and at least two other Iranian American prisoners if Washington reciprocated by releasing 19 Iranian citizens convicted in the United States of circumventing sanctions.</p> <p>As if to buttress that proposal, state-run news media in Iran then reported that Rezaian was accused of “spying on Iran’s nuclear programs” and giving the U.S. government information on people and companies evading sanctions. </p> <p>The prisoner-swap maneuvering showed that, for Iran, Rezaian’s innocence was “immaterial” and that what mattered more was whether he could be used to extract political concessions from the United States, The Post argued in its latest submission to the U.N. Working Group in late November.</p> <p>“The Iranian Government’s indiscriminate, baseless, and constantly evolving theories and allegations — which continue to change even after the conclusion of his trial — provide yet further evidence that Rezaian has committed no crime and is entitled to immediate release and some form of compensation for his wrongful imprisonment,” it said.</p>  <p>Branigin reported from Washington.
