<span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocation">FRANKFURT</span> A German court has ruled against an online shopping site's use of Facebook's "like" button on Wednesday, dealing a further legal blow to the world's biggest social network in Germany.</p></span><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>The Duesseldorf district court said that retailer Peek &amp; Cloppenburg failed to obtain proper consent before transmitting its users' computer identities to Facebook, violating Germany's  data protection law and giving the retailer a commercial advantage.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The court found in favor of the North Rhine-Westphalia Consumer Association, which had complained that Peek &amp; Cloppenburg's Fashion ID website had grabbed user data and sent it to Facebook before shoppers had decided whether to click on the "like" button or not.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>"A mere link to a data protection statement at the foot of the website does not constitute an indication that data are  being or are about to be processed," the court said.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Peek &amp; Cloppenburg faces a penalty of up to 250,000 euros ($275,400) or six months' detention for a manager.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The case comes on the heels of a January ruling by Germany's highest court against Facebook's "friend finder" feature and an announcement last week by Germany's competition regulator that it was investigating Facebook for suspected abuse of market power with regard to data protection laws.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Facebook's ability to target advertising, helped by features such as its "like" button, drove a 52 percent revenue jump in the final quarter of 2015. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Germany, Europe's biggest economy, is one of the world's strictest enforcers of data protection laws and its citizens have a high sensibility to privacy issues.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>"The ruling has fundamental significance for the assessment of the legality of the 'like' function with respect to data protection," said lawyer Sebastian Meyer, who represented the consumer group in the case.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>"Companies should put pressure on the social network to adapt the 'like' function to the prevailing law." </p><span id="midArticle_9"/>

A first hearing in a case it has brought against Payback is due in a Munich court in May. </p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Peek &amp; Cloppenburg said that it had changed its deployment of the "like" button last year and now required users to activate social media before sharing data with Facebook. It said it would wait for the court's written reasons for its judgment before deciding whether to appeal.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
