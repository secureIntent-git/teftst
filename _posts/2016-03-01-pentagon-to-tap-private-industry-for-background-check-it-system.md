        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Still reeling from the massive OPM hack, the White House has said the Pentagon would handle the new agency's information technology (IT) to ensure its security, but gave no details.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The Pentagon's fiscal 2017 budget proposal includes $95 million in initial funding for the system, and foresees $520 million in additional spending through fiscal 2021, said Pentagon spokeswoman Army Lieutenant Colonel Valerie Henderson.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Hale said the new system would be developed and built over time, with some parts in place by the start of fiscal 2018, or sooner if possible. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Hale said the Pentagon was confident about working with contractors despite last year's breach.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>"We have quite a lot of faith in the cleared defense industry," he said. "We believe that we can develop this information technology with industry as safely as we could as if we were to do the development entirely in house."</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Hale said the new agency's IT structure would be designed to be flexible enough to support whatever new investigative process the government settled on for the new background check agency.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>The idea was to continuously evaluate information about people with security clearances, including "all kinds of sources" such as financial and travel records, he said. </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><p> (Reporting by Andrea Shalal; editing by John Stonestreet)</p><span id="midArticle_14"/></div>
