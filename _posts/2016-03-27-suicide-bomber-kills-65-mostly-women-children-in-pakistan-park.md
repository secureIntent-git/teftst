What kind of people target little children in a park?"</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Soon after the attack, the Punjab government ordered all public parks to be closed and announced three days of mourning in the province. The main shopping areas were shut down and many of the city's main roads were deserted. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The army was called in to control crowds outside the park. Some distraught, sobbing relatives clashed with police and rescue officials. </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Punjab has traditionally been more peaceful than other parts of Pakistan.
