    <p>You’re shocked, you’re outraged, and we understand. This is the place to explore all those feelings. Here’s our rundown of the most stunning snubs from this morning’s <span style="line-height: 20.8px;">68th Primetime Emmy nominations (of which there are many). </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">While there were many underdog victories – FX’s long-ignored <em>The Americans</em> scored multiple nominations for its finest season yet; <em>Game of Thrones</em>’ stars Kit Harington and Maisie Williams scored their first nominations – the snubs racked up too. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">One of the biggest omissions off the bat is Lady Gaga, who won the Golden Globe for her performance in <em>American Horror Story: Hotel</em> and wasn’t even nominated here. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">Another Globes favorite, Starz’ <em>Outlander</em>, was also widely snubbed. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">Also left out in the cold was the final season of CBS’ acclaimed <em>The Good Wife</em>. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">But let’s break this down by category (</span><a href="http://www.ew.com/article/2016/07/14/emmys-nominations-2016" style="line-height: 20.8px;">full list of Emmy nominations</a>):</p>
<p><strong>Drama Series</strong>: With <em>Mad Men</em> off the table, that left a major opening for a newcomer which was snatched up by USA’s Mr. Robot. But Starz’ <em>Outlander</em> couldn’t get a seat at the table for its second season. <em>The Good Wife</em> final season was left out too. At least Showtime’s <em>Homeland</em> got back in the game. </p>
<p><strong>Comedy Series</strong>: Netflix’s <em>Master of None</em> broke in for its smart debut season, but otherwise this category went pretty much as the critics predicted. If <em>Modern Family</em> wins yet again, the ABC his is set to surpass <em>Frasier</em> as the comedy with most wins ever. Some thought HBO’s <em>Girls</em> would stage a return this year for its improved fifth season, or that The CW’s Crazy Ex-Girlfriend would get some love, but nope. </p>
<p><strong>Limited series</strong>: Of course it’s <em>The People vs. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story</em>’s category to lose (despite an incredible season 2 of <em>Fargo</em>). Left behind this year: FX’s perpetual category bridesmaid <em>American Horror Story</em>. </p>
<p><strong>Drama actress</strong>: The big shock here is the riveting Keri Russell finally getting in for <em>The Americans</em>, and – to a lesser degree – the return of <em>Orphan Black</em>’s perpetual underdog Tatiana Maslany. Shut out was <span style="line-height: 1.6em;"><em>Good Wife</em> star Julianna Margulies for her final turn, and <em>The Leftovers</em> fan favorite Carrie Coon.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;"><strong>Drama actor</strong>: With Jon Hamm off the stage, this category was ready for some new blood too. Critics widely expected Showtime’s <em>Billions</em> stars </span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Paul Giamatti and Damian Lewis (at least voter favorite Giamatti) to get in, but their stocks didn’t rise today. Instead <em>Mr. Robot</em> star Rami Malek </span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">and <em>Americans</em>’ sensation Matthew Rhys (who I’d argue is has been the most snubbed actor of all in recent years) made it on the list.</span></p>
<p><strong>Comedy actress</strong>: <span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Can you believe <em>Veep</em> star Julia Louis-Dreyfus was snubbed? Of course you can’t, because she wasn’t, and she’ll almost certainly win yet again (setting a five-in-a-row record). But who definitely won’t be winning is <em>Crazy Ex </em>Rachel Bloom despite winning the Golden Globe this year. Instead Tracee Ellis Ross in <em>Black-ish</em> surprised for a slot. But fans of <em>Girls</em> star Lena Dunham, <em>Fresh Of the Boat</em>’s Constance Wu and <em>You’re the Worst</em>’s Aya Cash will have to wait until next year.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;"><strong>Comedy actor</strong>: Terrrific to see Aziz Ansari score a first nod for <em>Master of None,</em> as well as Thomas Middleditch get recognized for his twitchily empathetic performance in <em>Silicon Valley. </em>But there was on huge shut-out: <em>Big Bang Theory</em> star Jim Parsons, who has won a record-tying four times. Also we were hoping for a nod for Rob Lowe, if only because it would make Fox feel bad for axing <em>The Grinder</em>. </span></p>
<p><em style="line-height: 1.6em;"><strong>Much more to come, refresh page for latest… refresh, refresh, refresh it, you know you want to… </strong></em></p>
<p>The nominations were announced at the shockingly civilized hour of 11:30 a.m. ET this year instead of the usual morning news show-pandering time of 8:30 a.m. One of the primary benefits of this is it makes it much harder for stars to tell reporters during their obligatory reaction calls, “I was totally asleep and forgot all about the nominations when I got a call waking me up that I’d been nominated; I’m so shocked!” – which we never actually believed anyway. So perhaps this year actors will admit to watching the nominations being announced along with the rest of us. </p>
<p><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">The 68th Primetime Emmy Awards will be held on Sunday, Sept. 18 on ABC, with Jimmy Kimmel returning as host.</span></p>
