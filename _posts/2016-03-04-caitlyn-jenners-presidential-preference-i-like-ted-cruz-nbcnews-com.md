                    <p> Caitlyn Jenner said her favorite presidential candidate is Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, and is willing to be a "trans ambassador" for the conservative politician who once dismissed the idea of gender-open bathrooms as "lunacy." </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> "I like Ted Cruz," Jenner <a href="http://www.advocate.com/caitlyn-jenner/2016/3/02/she-cait-and-i-am-not-face-face-jenner">told the Advocate</a> in an interview marking the start of the second season of her reality show "I Am Cait" on the<a href="http://www.eonline.com/shows/i_am_cait"> E! </a>network. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Jenner, a gold-medal Olympic decathlete and a lifelong Republican, said she met Cruz before her transition to a woman last year and found him "very nice." </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> She called Cruz "a great constitutionalist, and a very articulate man." But she also acknowledged that, as an evangelical Christian, Cruz is "probably one of the worst ones when it comes to trans issues." </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Cruz told a conservative radio host in November that it was "lunacy" to allow "boys, with all the god-given equipment of boys" to share a shower room with girls, <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/ilanbenmeir/ted-cruz-obama-administration-support-for-trans-school-aged?utm_term=.kuEndwKRz#.usEjgn6vl">according to BuzzFeed</a>. </p>
                
              
                    
              
              
                
              
              
              
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                    
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
              
              
              
                    <p> But other things are more important, Jenner told the magazine. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> "Number one, if we don't have a country, we don't have trans issues," Jenner was quoted as saying. "We need jobs. We need a vibrant economy. I want every trans person to have a job. With $19 trillion in debt and it keeps going up, we're spending money we don't have. Eventually, it's going to end. And I don't want to see that. Socialism did not build this country. Capitalism did. Free enterprise. The people built it. And they need to be given the opportunity to build it back up." </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Jenner said she'd be willing to advise Cruz on trans-related issues â€” as his "trans ambassador." </p>
