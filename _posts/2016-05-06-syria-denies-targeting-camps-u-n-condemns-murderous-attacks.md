High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein said the attacks were almost certainly a deliberate war crime. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"Given these tent settlements have been in these locations for several weeks, and can be clearly viewed from the air, it is extremely unlikely that these murderous attacks were an accident," Zeid said in a statement.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>"My staff, along with other organizations, will leave no stone unturned in their efforts to research and record evidence of what appears to be a particularly despicable and calculated crime against an extremely vulnerable group of people," he said.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
