    <p>PACIFICA – The city manager of Pacifica has declared a local emergency after strong waves caused by El Nino storms ate away part of a sea wall in the coastal community, damaging the municipal pier and threatening several homes. </p> <p>The San Jose Mercury News reports City Manager Lori Tinfow announced Friday Pacifica will need state and federal assistance to “respond to the growing list of failing public infrastructure.” </p> <p>Crews have placed boulders at the bottom of an eroding cliff along Beach Boulevard to stop sea water from reaching the already soaked soil but the cliff has continued to crumble. </p> <p>Mayor Sue Digre says the ferocious waves in recent weeks have been relentless and longer from north to south than any she’s seen during her 25 years of living in Pacifica. </p>
