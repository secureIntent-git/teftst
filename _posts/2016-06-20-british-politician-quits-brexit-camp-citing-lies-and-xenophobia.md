For me that's a step too far," she told The Times newspaper.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"I don't want the Leave camp to be running this country and I don't want the messages coming out of that camp to form the basis of the kind of Britain that I want to live in and to bring my kids up in," she said.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The official Vote Leave organization was dismissive, with a spokesman saying they did not remember Warsi joining their campaign and were puzzled by her announcement.
