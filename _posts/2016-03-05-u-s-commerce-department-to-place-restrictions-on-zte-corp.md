<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">LONDON</span> The U.S. Commerce Department is set to place restrictions on exports of U.S. products by Chinese telecoms equipment maker ZTE Corp (<span id="symbol_000063.SZ_0">000063.SZ</span>) for allegedly violating U.S. export controls related to Iran, according to documents seen by Reuters.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The restrictions will take effect on Tuesday and will require ZTE’s U.S. suppliers to apply for an export license before shipping anything to ZTE in China. </p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The license applications generally will be denied, according to the restrictions imposed on ZTE and three affiliates.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The export curbs apply to any company worldwide that wants to ship U.S. products to ZTE Corp in China.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>“This is a significant new burden on trade with ZTE,” a senior official at the Commerce Department told Reuters.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>A spokesman for ZTE, based in Shenzhen, China, could not be reached for immediate comment. The company can appeal the action.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The Commerce Department investigated ZTE following reports by Reuters in 2012 that ZTE had signed contracts to ship millions of dollars worth of hardware and software from some of America's best-known tech firms to Iran’s largest telecom carrier, Telecommunication Co of Iran (TCI), and a unit of the consortium that controls it.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>The U.S. product makers - which included Microsoft Corp , IBM (<span id="symbol_IBM.N_2">IBM.N</span>), Hewlett-Packard Co., Oracle Corp (<span id="symbol_ORCL.N_3">ORCL.N</span>) and Dell Inc [DI.UL], among others, have all said they were not aware of the Iranian contracts.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Washington has long banned the sale of U.S.-made tech products to Iran.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>A day after the first Reuters article was published, a ZTE spokesman said the company would “curtail” its business in Iran. The company later issued a statement saying: "ZTE no longer seeks new customers in Iran and limits business activities with existing customers."</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>What effect the new export restrictions will have on ZTE’s business is not clear. </p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>It has stated on one of its websites that some of the largest U.S. tech companies, including Microsoft, Intel, IBM and Honeywell, “are all key strategic partners of ZTE.”</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>A spokeswoman for Microsoft said the company had a licensing agreement with ZTE but could not confirm if the Chinese company purchases other products. The other U.S. companies did not respond to requests for immediate comment.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>ZTE Corp is one of the world’s largest telecom equipment makers with operations in 160 countries, according to its website. Founded in 1985, its shares trade on both the Hong Kong and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Besides ZTE, the export curbs will apply to two Chinese affiliates, ZTE Kangxun Telecommunications Ltd and Beijing 8-Star, and an Iranian company, ZTE Parsian.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><span id="midArticle_16"/><p> (Editing by Alex Smith and Jason Neely)</p><span id="midArticle_17"/></div>
