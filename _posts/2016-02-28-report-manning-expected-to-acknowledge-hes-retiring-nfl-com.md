It appears 
   <a href="http://www.nfl.com/player/peytonmanning/2501863/profile">Peyton Manning</a> is inching closer toward deciding whether he will play in 2016. 
    
   <p><a href="http://www.denverpost.com/paige/ci_29570921/paige-broncos-peyton-manning-will-ride-off-into" target="_self">According to Denver Post</a> columnist Woody Paige, Manning will acknowledge by the end of next week that he is retiring. NFL Media Insider Ian Rapoport reported Feb. 1 that Manning told close friends that he expected to retire after the season. In addition, Manning has not told anyone in the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/teams/denverbroncos/profile?team=DEN">Broncos</a>' organization about whether or not he plans to retire, team and league sources told Rapoport on Saturday.</p>

   <p>A <a href="http://www.nfl.com/teams/denverbroncos/profile?team=DEN">Broncos</a> spokesman told NFL Media's James Palmer that the Denver Post report "is news to us" and that the team is continuing to talk with Manning about his future. Manning must undergo a team physical by Friday if he plans to play in 2016, Rapoport added.</p> 
   <p>Speaking at the NFL <a href="http://www.nfl.com/combine">Scouting Combine</a> on Thursday, <a href="http://www.nfl.com/teams/denverbroncos/profile?team=DEN">Broncos</a> general manager John Elway said he's not pushing Manning to make a decision on retirement.</p> 
   <p>"I met with Peyton a couple nights ago and we had a good talk," Elway said. "As I said after the game, we'll give him as much time as he needs. He still needs some more time so we're going to afford him that time. He deserves it after 18 years in this league."</p> 
   <p>Elway reiterated several times that he's not pressuring Manning one way or the other and will meet with the quarterback again in seven to 10 days.</p> 
   <p>The <a href="http://www.nfl.com/teams/denverbroncos/profile?team=DEN">Broncos</a> executive shot down suggestions that he needs Manning's decision sooner rather than later so he can move forward on contract negotiations with <a href="http://www.nfl.com/player/brockosweiler/2533436/profile">Brock Osweiler</a>.</p> 
   <p>"We're really not in a hurry," Elway said. "It's really fluid. We know where Brock is and he knows what we have to offer. We still have a great deal of interest in Brock and we'd like to do something with Brock. We'll start down those tracks and we'll start talking to Brock about a new contract and see what we can do there. But with that in mind, also affording Peyton the time that he deserves. We're not in any rush. Like I said we have 12 days and we don't feel like we're in a rush there. We'll continue to talk to Peyton during that time and continue to work with Brock and get something done with Brock."</p>
