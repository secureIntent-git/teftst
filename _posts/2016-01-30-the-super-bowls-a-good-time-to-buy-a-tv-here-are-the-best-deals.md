<br><div id=""><p>It is the best of times to buy a TV, it is the worst of times to buy a TV. Each year’s Super Bowl presents a conundrum for consumers: Only weeks before at <a href="http://www.wired.com/tag/ces" target="_blank">CES</a>, a slew of amazing new sets were announced, and prices have plunged on all of <em>last year’s</em> best TVs. However (this is the conundrum part) the way things are moving in TV land, settling for last year’s top model often means missing out on future-friendly features. Those new TVs we saw at CES had new treats like support for <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/01/what-is-hdr-tv/">HDR video</a>, with panels that produce brighter brights and inkier blacks.</p>
<p>But don’t worry too much. Last year’s top-tier 4K sets are still excellent. Your eyeballs and wallet will be pleased—because they’ve never been cheaper. Super Bowl TV deals are a bit different from those Black Friday doorbusters. On Black Friday, already-cheap sets generally get cheaper. In the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl, though, top-of-the-line TVs get drastic price cuts. These panels have refresh rates fast enough to <a href="http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-fantasy-live/0ap3000000601591/NFL-Fantasy-Live-How-fast-is-Ted-Ginn">keep up with Ted Ginn, Jr.</a>, and resolutions sharp enough to examine <a href="http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-game-highlights/0ap3000000627571/Owen-Daniels-gets-confused-on-the-sideline">every majestic hair on Owen Daniels’ head</a>. Keep in mind that the big game won’t be broadcast in 4K, but that’s a myopic reason to refrain from splurging on an Ultra HD set. After all, you’re not just buying a TV for the Super Bowl, you’re buying it for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZW9cT8VJc8">superb owls in 4K</a>.</p>
<p>So you can’t go wrong if you buy now, and you also can’t go wrong if you wait. Buying now gets you an awesome deal on an awesome set, and waiting a bit longer gets you a state-of-the-art panel for a hefty price… until next year’s Super Bowl.</p>
<h3>$1,000 Off on LG’s 4K OLEDs</h3>
<p>Let’s be real: Spending $3,000 to $5,000 on a TV isn’t exactly a super-cheap proposition. But when we’re talking about LG’s 4K OLED sets—the epitome of stunning picture quality—it’s worth considering. LG just announced deep cuts on its <a href="http://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-55EF9500-oled-4k-tv">55-inch EF9500</a> (flat) and <a href="http://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-55EG9600-oled-4k-tv">EG9600</a> (curved) 4K OLED TVs; they’re both $3,000 now—one thousand dollars less than they were last year. The <a href="http://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-65EF9500-oled-4k-tv">65-inch versions</a> of <a href="http://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-65EG9600-oled-4k-tv">each set</a> go for $5,000 now. And if you buy either set on the day of the Super Bowl through February 13, they’ll throw in a free 4K TV or $300 gift card for the higher-priced sets and a free HDTV or $200 gift card for the lower-priced sets. (Oh, and there are even deeper cuts on LG’s 4K LCD sets, to the tune of <a href="http://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-65UF9500-4k-uhd-led-tv">$2,000 off</a> the regular price).</p>

<p>When Samsung’s 55-inch JS9000 SUHD TV was announced last year, its initial price clocked in at around $4,000. Now you can find it <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TS76VOK/?tag=w050b-20">on Amazon for around $2,200</a>, and it’s a beauty: 4K resolution with quantum-dot color enhancement and a bright backlight system that comes in handy for watching HDR video. Sure, its curved screen isn’t exactly optimal for having a house full of guests over for the Super Bowl, but its fetching industrial design sort of has a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=lombardi+trophy&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=896&amp;bih=633&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-26Gp2s_KAhXL0h4KHcZRC6sQ_AUIBigB" target="_blank">Lombardi Trophy vibe</a>.<br/><a href="http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/sony-tv.jpg"><img src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1454189002_859_The-Super-Bowls-a-Good-Time-to-Buy-a-TV-Here-Are-the-Best-Deals.jpg" alt="sony-tv" width="582" height="465" class="alignnone size-default-top-art wp-image-1966982"/></a></p>
<h3>$1,000 Off on Sony’s Slim 4K Set</h3>
<p>$1,500 for a 55-inch 4K TV with an impossibly slim profile and a built-in Chromecast? Sure, I’m listening. Sony’s 55-inch XBR X900C stunned us at CES last year with its slimmer-than-an-iPhone screen, and it can be (professionally) installed to appear like it’s nearly flush with your wall. This panel runs Android TV, which means more than apps; it also means you won’t need any dongles to get Chromecast features. It normally goes for around $2,500, but it’s available for $1,500 at <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00R45XL64/?tag=w050b-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-55-class-54-1-2-diag--led-2160p-smart-3d-4k-ultra-hd-tv-black/2639119.p?id=1219551828254&amp;skuId=2639119">Best Buy</a>.<br/><a href="http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/mseries-overview_V2-tv.jpg"><img src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1454189002_159_The-Super-Bowls-a-Good-Time-to-Buy-a-TV-Here-Are-the-Best-Deals.jpg" alt="mseries-overview_V2-tv" width="582" height="465" class="alignnone size-default-top-art wp-image-1966987"/></a></p>
<h3>$200 to $350 Off on Vizio’s 4K M Series</h3>
<p>Vizio’s schtick is “bang for the buck,” and the company’s mid-range M series sets represent the sweet spot in terms of performance for the price. They’re 4K TVs with full-array backlight systems and local dimming—picture-uniformity and contrast boosters that you normally only find on really expensive sets—and now they cost less than ever. The <a href="http://www.vizio.com/football/m65c1.html">65-inch M series set is now listed at $1,350</a> (down from $1,700), while the <a href="http://www.vizio.com/football/m60c3.html">60-incher will set you back a mere $1,000</a> (down from $1,200).<br/><figure attachment_1966985="" class="wp-caption landscape alignnone  relative" data-js="fader"><a href="http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/H7-Clarity-tv.jpg"><img src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1454189002_512_The-Super-Bowls-a-Good-Time-to-Buy-a-TV-Here-Are-the-Best-Deals.jpg" alt="H7-Clarity-tv" width="1024" height="819" class="size-large wp-image-1966985"/></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text link-underline"><span class="credit link-underline-sm"><span aria-hidden="true" class="ui ui ui-photo inline-block ui-credit relative opacity-5 marg-r-micro"/> hisense</span></figcaption></figure></p>
<h3>Hisense’s Sub-$1,000 4K TVs and Sub-$300 Roku HDTV</h3>
<p>Hisense is an electronics juggernaut in China, and if the company keeps up these kinds of deals, it may soon be a household name in the U.S. Over on Amazon, there are a slew of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Delectronics&amp;field-keywords=hisense">sub-$1,000 deals on the company’s H7 4K lineup</a>, with screen sizes as big as 65 inches. And hey, this year’s Super Bowl will be streaming for free on the CBS Sports App for Roku, so why not pick up a set with Roku baked right into it? That’s the draw of <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00U0GZR34/?tag=w050b-20">this HD-only 40-inch Hisense TV</a>, which is going for just $280.</p>
<figure attachment_1966989="" class="wp-caption landscape alignnone  relative" data-js="fader"><a href="http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Roku-tv.jpg"><img src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1454189002_389_The-Super-Bowls-a-Good-Time-to-Buy-a-TV-Here-Are-the-Best-Deals.jpg" alt="Roku-tv" width="582" height="466" class="size-default-top-art wp-image-1966989"/></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text link-underline"><span class="credit link-underline-sm"><span aria-hidden="true" class="ui ui ui-photo inline-block ui-credit relative opacity-5 marg-r-micro"/> Roku</span></figcaption></figure><h3>TCL’s 48-Inch Roku TV for $350</h3>
<p>Speaking of Roku TVs and gigantic Chinese companies, TCL also has some skin in the game. If you want a larger screen for your built-in Roku action, the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SG473MK/?tag=w050b-20">48-inch FS3700 is now available for $350 on Amazon</a>. It’s “only” a 1080p set, but your wallet will thank you when 3D 8K HDR OLED PAL/NTSC DVR TVs cost around $100 in a few years.</p>
