<p>Looks like we won’t have to wait until next year’s <em>Episode VIII</em> to see our favorite characters from <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em> again. OK, that’s only <em>kind of</em> true. If you consider “watching animated Lego versions of” characters “seeing” them, then you’ll definitely be seeing them again soon—like three-days-from-now soon. If not, then you’ll probably still be waiting until 2017. </p>
<p>The new animated short <em>Lego Star Wars: The Resistance Rises—Poe to the Rescue</em>, which will debut Monday on Disney XD, will feature, yes, Poe Dameron as well as Kylo Ren, Captain Phasma, BB-8, and others. (C-3PO! Hey girl!) The short is the first episode in the <em>Resistance Rises</em> series, which explains what happened in the events leading up to the First Order attack on Jakku in <em>The Force Awakens</em>. </p>
<p>Also, it looks really fun. Just look at little itty bitty Kylo Ren stomping off of that ship! </p>
<p>Check out a preview of the short, which will premiere after Monday’s <em>Gravity Falls</em> finale, above. </p>
