<br><div id="start-of-content"><article class="content link-underline relative body-copy" data-js="content" itemprop="articleBody" readability="46.920298879203"><p>Not too long ago, our podcast booth was full of merriment. For countless minutes we would regale each other with recaps of our favorite moments on <a href="http://www.wired.com/tag/game-of-thrones/" target="_blank"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a> and just laugh and laugh. That was like two weeks ago. This week, however, we’re worried. Sunday’s episode of HBO’s massive fantasy series was, well, dull. And we’re starting to wonder if the wheels are falling off of Westeros. </p>



<p>Luckily, we have a lot of other cultural highlights to lift our spirits. For one, we can finally talk openly about <a href="http://www.wired.com/tag/captain-america-civil-war/" target="_blank"><em>Captain America: Civil War</em></a>, including that post-credits scene that got us so stoked. There’s also the return of <em>Penny Dreadful</em> and new albums <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/05/how-to-listen-radiohead-new-album/" target="_blank">from Radiohead</a> and James Blake. For every wound, there is a salve. </p>
<p>So come share in our joy and pain, won’t you? We’ve got a meager but mighty pair—editors Peter Rubin and Angela Watercutter—in the booth and we need to talk to you about some things. Sit down, this won’t hurt one bit. </p>
<p>A few helpful links for things we talk about in the podcast:</p>
