<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocation">TOKYO</span> Mitsubishi Motors Corp (<span id="symbol_7211.T_0">7211.T</span>) is confident it has enough cash to weather a damaging fuel efficiency scandal alone, even as it warned incorrect data may have been used for more of its cars.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The Japanese carmaker last month admitted to overstating the fuel economy of four of its models - small cars sold in Japan, including two under Nissan Motor's badge.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>On Wednesday, it said it suspected improper data was used for models among the nine current ones on the market, as well as models it no longer sells. Overseas models are not affected. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Analysts have estimated that Mitsubishi may have to pay close to $1 billion to compensate Japanese mini-vehicle customers over lost 'eco-car' tax breaks and extra fuel costs.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>"Our finances through the year just ended have been strong, so we think we can manage the issue," Chief Executive Osamu Masuko told a press conference.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"We haven't approached our sister companies for financial support."</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>After a scandal more than 15 years ago - in which Mitsubishi Motors admitted systematically covering up customer complaints for more than two decades - Mitsubishi group companies came to its support. They rescued the auto arm with a major bailout.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Since the latest scandal broke on April 20, in the wake of last year's Volkswagen (<span id="symbol_VOWG_p.DE_1">VOWG_p.DE</span>) diesel emissions revelations, the Japanese company's market value has fallen by around 42 percent, or $3 billion, on fears of compensation costs and collapsing sales.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Mitsubishi Motors holds $4 billion in cash, and little debt.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Earlier in the day, Mitsubishi submitted an additional explanation to Japan's transport ministry after officials found more irregularities with its vehicles following a raid on the company's research facilities last month.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>It again blamed intense competition for the manipulation, as well as insufficient communication with a subcontractor, also owned by Mitsubishi. </p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>"The coordinators at the time were well aware that fuel consumption meant 'the factor that would give the most product marketing appeal'; so they felt that the fuel consumption improvement targets requested by managers and executives were absolute," it said in a statement.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>But a transport ministry official said that the fresh information was insufficient, as it did not confirm which models were using non-compliant data, or had overstated fuel economy readings.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Masuko said he expected the company to explain "everything" by May 18, the deadline set by the transport ministry for all Japanese automakers to submit reconfirmed fuel economy readings.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><span id="midArticle_15"/><p> (Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Writing by Chris Gallagher and Clara Ferreira Marques; Editing by Alexander Smith)</p><span id="midArticle_16"/></div>
