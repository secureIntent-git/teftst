<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="7"><p><span class="articleLocation">KALAMAZOO, Mich.</span> The Michigan Uber driver charged with murdering six people switched vehicles after sideswiping a car at the start of the shooting spree, authorities said on Tuesday, adding they hoped his phone would help establish a motive for the killings.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>It was also disclosed that the suspect, Jason Dalton, visited a gun shop shortly before the shootings and bought a heavy-duty jacket that could conceal a small pistol.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Dalton, 45, was denied bail on Monday after a court hearing in which a detective testified that he admitted to the five-hour shooting rampage over the weekend in Kalamazoo, Michigan, about 150 miles (240 km) west of Detroit. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Hours before the first shooting occurred on Saturday evening, Dalton and a friend visited Southwick's, a gun shop he frequented in nearby Plainwell, a shop employee told Reuters.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Dalton was a regular customer who usually spent time chatting with the staff, but he bought the jacket and left the store within 10 minutes, said the employee, who asked not to be identified.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>"He’s in here enough for me to know he talks to the guys about guns and different stuff,” she said.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Searching for a motive for the violence, investigators focused on a 9mm semi-automatic handgun and a cellphone seized from Dalton and accounts that he picked up fares for the Uber car-hailing service between the shooting episodes, authorities said. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Prosecutors say Dalton randomly shot at people at an apartment complex, a car dealership and a restaurant, killing six and wounding two.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>"Right after the first shooting at the apartments, he left the scene and sideswiped a car," said Paul Matyas of the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Department. The accident prompted him to switch cars, from a silver Chevrolet Equinox to a Chevy HHR, both vehicles belonging to his family, Matyas said.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>One Uber customer he picked up was Matthew Mellen, who told CNN that Dalton seemed normal until he received a call on his cellphone, after which he began driving erratically, running stop lights and a stop sign and sideswiping another vehicle as Mellen yelled for him to pull over. </p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Mellen, recounting that Dalton drove an Equinox, said he got out after Dalton finally stopped, then ran away and called 911.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>County prosecutor Jeffrey Getting told Reuters that authorities believed Dalton was picking up fares between shootings and possibly afterward.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Matyas said investigators were examining Dalton's Uber contacts and working to "track his phone calls, track his whereabouts" in the hours before his arrest early on Sunday.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Dalton had no prior criminal record.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>"We are no closer to a motive two days later than 10 minutes after he was arrested," Matyas said.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>The two surviving victims include Abigail Kopf, 14, listed in critical condition, and Tiana Carruthers, 25, who was seriously wounded but is expected to recover.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><span id="midArticle_1"/><p> (Additional reporting by Barbara Goldberg in New York and Jon Herskovitz in Austin, Texas; Editing by Tom Brown and Peter Cooney)</p><span id="midArticle_2"/></div>
