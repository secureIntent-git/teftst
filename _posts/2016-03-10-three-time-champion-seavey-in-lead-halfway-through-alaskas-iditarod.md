"Dallas is sick and he is not his usual happy self, instead he has this grim determination. He is dangerous."</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Noah Burmeister, racing for the first time since 2008, has been challenging perennial favorites and trailed Dallas Seavey by 20 miles heading into Cripple.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Former champions Robert Sorlie, John Baker, Lance Mackey and Jeff King were among six others trailing Seavey. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
