He plans to travel to Nice later Friday.</p><p><h3>'It keeps getting worse'</h3></p><p>While the identity of the Nice attacker is unknown, experts say the previous terror attacks have been by terrorists from disenfranchised communities. </p><p>"You have a very large disaffected North African community. They are French citizens now ... but they've been excluded from French society," Robert Baer, a former CIA operative, told CNN's Don Lemon. </p><p>"I went to school in France ... I worked there and they are really totally excluded," Baer added.</p><p>"And it keeps getting worse since attacks in Paris because they are using profiling and they are stopping people who look like Arabs on trains and buses, checking their IDs which we don't even do in this country. The French have been very aggressive ... radicalization of people of North African origin is actually picking up rather than lessening."</p><p>Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director who served on the executive board of Interpol, said homegrown terrorism is a major concern in Europe. </p><p>"We have third generation immigrants that came there from Morocco, Algeria, Libya, Tunisia ... and even when their children are born in France and their children's children are born in France, they don't consider themselves French," he said.</p><p>"These immigrant populations stay in confined neighborhoods and only assimilate with each other and aren't accepted into the general population."</p><div class="zn-body__paragraph" readability="16.61797752809">Fuentes said the radicalization of <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/12/us/orlando-nightclub-shooting/">"homegrown people" is becoming an issue</a> in the United States as well<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/specials/san-bernardino-shooting"> following the attacks in San Bernardino, California, </a>and Orlando, Florida. </div></div>
