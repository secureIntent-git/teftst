        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>For big business houses, ecommerce is an opportunity to capitalize on middle class growth and rapid internet adoption. By 2025, online merchandise sales will hit $220 billion in India from $11 billion last year, Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimated.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>But the market has fostered cut-price competition, with the top three players incurring millions of dollars in losses due to heavy discounts.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Tata said its focus was profit margins and unit economics, and not just growing sales via discounts.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
