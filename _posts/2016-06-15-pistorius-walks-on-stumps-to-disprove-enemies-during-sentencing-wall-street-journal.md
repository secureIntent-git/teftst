      --> <p>PRETORIA, South Africa—<!--
        --> <a href="http://topics.wsj.com/person/P/Oscar-Pistorius/7202">Oscar Pistorius</a><!--
      --> hobbled on his stumps in front of a South African court as his chief lawyer said the former athlete’s murder trial had created a series of “serious enemies” in the form of popular misconceptions.</p> <p> <!--
        --> Barry Roux<!--
      --> asked his client to remove his prostheses and walk on his stumps before Judge Thokozile Masipa during the hearing which will determine Mr. Pistorius’ sentence for killing girlfriend <!--
        --> Reeva Steenkamp<!--
      --> in 2013. The former Paralympic champion is facing 15 years in jail, but Mr. Roux argued that he deserves a more lenient sentence.</p> <p>In his final arguments to Judge Masipa, Mr. Roux asked Mr. Pistorius to remove his prosthetic limbs to debunk one of the “enemies” of the case—perceived misunderstandings around the defendant’s motives and mobility when he shot Ms. Steenkamp multiple times through a toilet cubicle door in his home three years ago.</p> <p>Mr. Roux told the court it was not the “strong, ambitious” Mr. Pistorius, the history-making Olympic runner and multiple Paralympic gold medalist, who fired four shots that night. Rather, it was a disabled man standing on his stumps and in fear for his life, his attorney argued.</p> <p>“It was not the man winning gold medals that must be judged,” the defense lawyer said. “[Popular belief suggests it] is a 1.85-meter man standing on his stumps at 3 o’clock in the morning in the dark that must be judged.”</p> <p>Later, Mr. Roux said: “They want to see Oscar Pistorius running to the bathroom with his gold medal around his neck.”</p> <p>Mr. Roux argued that the prosecution’s allegation of a loud fight between Mr. Pistorius and his girlfriend before the shooting had never been proved. The lawyer also said people believed his client was convicted of murder for intentionally killing Ms. Steenkamp, even though the ruling didn’t say that Mr. Pistorius knew it was his girlfriend behind the door. The athlete has always claimed he mistook her for an intruder.</p> <p>The lawyer said “substantial and compelling circumstances” existed that would allow the judge to deviate from the minimum term of 15 years in prison for murder in South Africa. He also referred to another high-profile case in South Africa, in which a rugby player who shot dead his daughter after mistaking her for an intruder was not prosecuted.</p> <p>Mr. Roux’s plea to Judge Masipa followed the testimony of the final witness at the hearing, a cousin of Ms. Steenkamp, who accused Mr. Pistorius himself of not giving the “true version” of the shooting.</p> <p>The cousin, <!--
        --> Kim Martin,<!--
      --> also criticized the defendant for not testifying at this week’s sentencing hearing but agreeing to a television interview that will be broadcast after the hearing ends.</p> <p>“I think it’s very unfair to want to talk to the world about your version when you had the opportunity in court to do so,” Martin said under questioning from chief prosecutor <!--
        --> Gerrie Nel.<!--
      --></p> <p>Ms. Martin also questioned Pistorius’ statement that he killed Steenkamp by mistake thinking an intruder was in the house.</p> <p>“All we’ve ever wanted is the truth,” Martin said. “People say we’ve got the truth, but we didn’t. Oscar’s version has changed so many times. I don’t feel the true version came out.”</p> <p>Mr. Pistorius is currently living under house arrest after initially serving one year of a five-year prison sentence for manslaughter for shooting his girlfriend multiple times in 2013. That conviction was overturned last year by an appeals court, which convicted the former Paralympic champion of the more serious charge of murder.</p> <!--
      --> 
<!--
      --> <p>As Mr. Roux spoke about the shooting, Mr. Pistorius hunched over in the courtroom and held his head in his hands. At other times, he sat up straight on his wooden bench.</p> <p>Judge Masipa, who initially acquitted Pistorius of murder before her decision was overturned, will also decide the new sentence. The hearing is scheduled to run through Friday this week. South Africa’s minimum sentence of 15 years in prison for murder can be reduced in some circumstances.</p> <p>While prosecutors are seeking a long jail term for the 29-year-old Pistorius, his defense has argued that he should be spared prison and allowed to do community work with children.</p> <p>In her testimony, Martin, Steenkamp’s cousin, said she and her family are struggling to cope with Steenkamp’s death and that every Valentine’s Day—the day when Steenkamp was fatally shot—is the “worst day for us.”</p> <p>Martin said her family lights a candle for Steenkamp, a model, at Christmas and that they try to celebrate such special days despite the grief.</p> <p>“We don’t want every occasion to become a funeral,” she said.</p>
