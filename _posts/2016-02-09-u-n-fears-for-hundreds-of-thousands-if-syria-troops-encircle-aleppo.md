The United Nations urged Ankara on Tuesday to open the border and has called on other countries to assist Turkey with aid.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said as many as a million refugees could arrive if the Russian-Syrian campaign continues. Fifty thousand people had reached Turkey's borders in the latest wave, Ankara had admitted 10,000 so far and would allow in others in a "controlled fashion", he said.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>The U.N. World Food Programme said in a statement it had begun food distribution in the Syrian town of Azaz near the Turkish border for the new wave of displaced people.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>LITTLE HOPE TO REVIVE TALKS</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>“The situation is quite volatile and fluid in northern Aleppo with families on the move seeking safety,” said Jakob Kern, WFP’s country director in Syria.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>“We are extremely concerned as access and supply routes from the north to eastern Aleppo city and surrounding areas are now cut off, but we are making every effort to get enough food in place for all those in need, bringing it in through the remaining open border crossing point from Turkey.”</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>The Russian-backed government assault around Aleppo, as well as advances further south, helped torpedo the first peace talks for nearly two years, which collapsed last week before they got under way in earnest.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>International powers are due to meet on Thursday in Munich in a bid to resurrect the talks, but diplomats hold out virtually no hope for negotiations as long as the Russian-backed government offensive is under way at full bore. Rebels say they will not attend without a halt to bombing.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Moscow turned the momentum in the war in favor of its ally President Bashar al-Assad when it joined the conflict four months ago with a campaign of air strikes against his enemies, many of whom are supported by Arab states, Turkey and the West.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel accused Russia this week of bombing civilians, against a U.N. Security Council resolution Moscow signed up to in December. Russia says it is targeting only Islamist militants. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there was no credible evidence of civilian deaths.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The complex multi-sided civil war has drawn in outside powers, with the United States leading a separate campaign of air strikes against Islamic State militants who control eastern Syria and northern Iraq.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>A suicide bomber drove his car into a police officers' club in a residential quarter in central Damascus on Tuesday, blowing himself up and killing several people, a Syrian interior ministry statement said.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors violence in the war, said eight police officers were killed and 20 wounded in the blast.
