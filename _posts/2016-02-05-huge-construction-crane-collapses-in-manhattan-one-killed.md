<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">NEW YORK</span> A construction crane collapsed in lower Manhattan during a swirling snowstorm on Friday, killing one person, injuring three others and crushing cars parked in the street.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Hundreds of emergency workers responded after the 565-foot-tall crane toppled at about 8:30 a.m. EST and flipped upside down, leaving the metal boom stretched along nearly two city blocks.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>At the time, workers were lowering the crane to secure it as winds approached 25 miles per hour, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a news conference.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>It was not yet known if wind played a role in the collapse. An investigation was underway and the crane operator was being interviewed, de Blasio said.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Manhattan resident David Wichs, 38, was killed in the collapse, police said. Three others had non-life-threatening injuries, including two with head lacerations, officials said.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>De Blasio said pedestrians has been cleared from the street before workers began lowering the crane, averting a potentially greater calamity during the morning rush to work. "Thank God it was not worse," he said.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The crane was owned by Bay Crane, based in the New York City borough of Queens, and operated by Queens-based GTI, or Galasso Trucking. A person who answered the phone at Bay Crane declined to comment. A Galasso representative could not be reached.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>The crane had been used since Jan. 30 at 60 Hudson Street, a landmark once known as the Western Union building. Workers were replacing generators and air conditioning equipment on the roof, officials said. The building is a major hub for telecommunications companies.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>De Blasio said inspectors had visited the site on Thursday and recorded no safety concerns.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer issued a statement on Friday criticizing the buildings department for not implementing certain safety improvements.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>"Crane safety is a crisis, but the city has not treated it like one," Stringer said.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>A buildings department spokesman disputed Stringer's assertions and said there is "more oversight of cranes in place than ever before."</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>The "crawler crane" that fell is among 376 used in construction in New York City. Another 53 taller "tower cranes" are also being operated in the city.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>After Friday's collapse, the city ordered all cranes to be shut down and secured due to the wind.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Witnesses described a deafening boom as the crane crashed to the street a few blocks from City Hall and a half-mile from the World Trade Center site.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>Nicholi White, 20, who works for online grocer Fresh Direct, said he was waiting to deliver boxes when he saw it fall.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>"When the crane hit the ground, I heard a loud bang, it sounded like a bomb," he said. "One of the loudest sounds I heard in my life."</p><span id="midArticle_1"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>A woman who was having her hair done at a nearby salon in preparation for her wedding at City Hall was escorted to the ceremony after the collapse by a fire department chaplain.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Four buildings were damaged, city officials said. They said they were also monitoring multiple gas leaks, none of which had risen to dangerous levels.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Wichs worked at financial trading firm Tower Research Capital in New York. A woman who answered the phone there  declined to give her name but said the office staff was "deeply saddened." She called Wichs a wonderful person.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Officials said Friday's incident was the first fatal crane collapse involving a city-inspected crane since 2008. That year, nine people were killed in two separate collapses, prompting officials to impose stricter regulations on the industry.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>In 2012, a construction crane partially collapsed on top of a nearly completed, 90-story apartment building during high winds brought by Superstorm Sandy. In 2013, a crane collapsed in Queens, injuring seven.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Last May, a cable on a construction crane also owned by Bay Crane snapped at a high-rise office building in Midtown Manhattan as it lifted an air conditioning unit. The unit plunged nearly 30 stories, injuring 10 people.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><span id="midArticle_8"/><p> (Additional reporting by Herb Lash, Frank McGurty, <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=scott.malone&amp;">Scott Malone</a>, Suzannah Gonzales, <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=brendanmcdermid&amp;">Brendan McDermid</a> and Dan Burns; Writing by <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=josephax&amp;">Joseph Ax</a>; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe, <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=toni.reinhold&amp;">Toni Reinhold</a>)</p><span id="midArticle_9"/></div>
