<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocation">WASHINGTON</span> Two U.S. senators on Wednesday issued a formal draft of a controversial bill that would give courts the power to order technology companies like Apple to help authorities break into encrypted devices or communications for law enforcement or intelligence purposes.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The proposal arrives just days after an earlier draft leaked online and drew fire from security researchers and civil liberties advocates who warned it would undermine Internet security and expose personal data to hackers.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Those same groups on Wednesday said the new draft is little different from the leaked version.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The bill comes as the U.S. Justice Department has redoubled its efforts to use the courts to force Apple (<span id="symbol_AAPL.O_0">AAPL.O</span>) to unlock encrypted iPhones.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Senators Richard Burr and Dianne Feinstein, the Senate intelligence committee's Republican chair and top Democrat, said in a statement they intended now to "solicit input from the public and key stakeholders before formally introducing the bill."</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"I am hopeful that this draft will start a meaningful and inclusive debate on the role of encryption and its place within the rule of law," Burr said. "Based on initial feedback, I am confident that the discussion has begun."</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The new discussion draft does not require manufacturers or communications companies to process, transmit or store data in any particular format. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Rather, it requires companies, upon receipt of a court order, to turn over to the government "data in an intelligible format" even if encryption has rendered that data inaccessible to anyone other than the owner.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Companies must ensure their products "be capable of complying," the bill states. Critics say that amounts to a ban on strong encryption.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>The latest version of the bill narrows the scope of cases where a court can issue an order. Those include crimes that caused or could cause death or serious injury or that involve drug offenses or child victims, in addition to foreign intelligence operations, according to the text.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Andrew Crocker, staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, said changes in the new discussion draft were minimal and the bill still threatened Internet security because companies would only be able to comply by weakening encryption in all their products.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>The proposed legislation, which is expected to continue facing strong opposition from the technology sector and privacy advocates, faces an uphill battle in a gridlocked Congress.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>"This flawed bill would leave Americans more vulnerable to stalkers, identity thieves, foreign hackers and criminals," said Democratic Senator Ron Wyden in a statement.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><span id="midArticle_14"/><p> (Reporting By Mark Hosenball and Dustin Volz in Washington; Editing by Andrew Hay)</p><span id="midArticle_15"/></div>
