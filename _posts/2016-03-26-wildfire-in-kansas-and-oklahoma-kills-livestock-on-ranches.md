The gusts failed to significantly expand the roughly 400,000-acre wildfire.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Earlier in the week, the blaze dubbed the Anderson Creek Fire was driven by winds of up to 60 mph as it exploded in size.   </p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>In Oklahoma, where the blaze continues to burn, firefighters earlier on Friday scrambled to get equipment in place ahead of what forecasters had predicted would be a blustery evening. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>They were able to build a containment line and are hopeful it will hold, said Melanie Karns, a spokeswoman for a Texas-based team that is helping to battle the blaze. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>"It's going to be looking good in the next couple days hopefully, as long as we can stay ahead of it," she said. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>No injuries to people have been reported, but an unknown number of livestock have been killed by the fire, Bauman said.
