<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocatio&lt;/span&gt;n">Corvex Management LP disclosed on Monday that it owns 9.9 percent of Pandora Media Inc and urged the internet music streaming company to explore a sale instead of pursuing a "costly and uncertain business plan." </span></p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Corvex, a hedge fund run by Keith Meister, a protégé of billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, said it had met with the company's management and had withdrawn a plan to replace some of its board members. However, it now believes Pandora should hire an investment bank to help the company explore its strategic options including a sale.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>"We believe there is likely to be significant strategic interest in the company at a substantial premium to the company's recent stock price," Corvex said, adding that large internet companies, handset makers and media companies could be potential buyers.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Pandora's shares are down more than 25 percent in 2016 and more than 45 percent year-over-year. Corvex owns about 22.7 million shares in the company, making the hedge fund Pandora's largest shareholder. </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Pandora said in response that it is in constant dialogue with shareholders and committed to achieving long-term value for them. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"Pandora has a profitable core business, combined with a strong balance sheet. We are confidently investing to fully capture the massive opportunity ahead of us," the company said in a statement. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Oakland, California-based Pandora has faced tough competition from music-streaming rivals such as Spotify, Apple Inc , Alphabet Inc's  Google and Amazon.com and has failed to turn an annual profit as a public company. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Analysts have said Pandora, which had a market capitalization of $2.29 billion on Monday, could be an acquisition target for larger media or internet companies looking to beef up their online music offerings. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Pandora co-founder Tim Westergren, a former musician who spearheaded Pandora's music algorithm technology, returned to the company March 28 to become CEO, squashing some investors' hopes the company could be sold.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Westergren told Reuters on April 15, "If you want to sell a company, you don't do that by spending half a billion on acquisitions and hiring a new CEO."</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Unlike other streaming services, which have negotiated deals with record labels to allow listeners to pick songs, Pandora has acted more like a radio station, playing songs that match a genre but not allowing customers to make selections. </p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Pandora is now playing catch-up and negotiating with record labels for the licenses it needs to offer more on-demand music services.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><span id="midArticle_14"/><p> (additional reporting by Julia Love in San Francisco; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Andrew Hay)</p><span id="midArticle_15"/></div>
