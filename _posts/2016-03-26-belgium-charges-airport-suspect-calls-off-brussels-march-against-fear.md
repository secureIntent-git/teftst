        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The authorities also said that a man arrested on Friday after being shot in the leg at a tram stop in the Brussels district of Schaerbeek was being held for a further 24 hours.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>He was identified as Abderamane A. and was one of three people arrested on Friday. </p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>That operation was linked to the arrest in Paris on Thursday of an Islamist convicted in Belgium last year and suspected of plotting a new attack, Belgian prosecutors said.      </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>BRUSSELS MARCH</p><span id="midArticle_14"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>With Brussels still on high alert, organizers called off a "march against fear" planned for Sunday after officials including the city's mayor urged people to stay away in order to spare the over-taxed police force. </p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>"The security of our citizens is an absolute priority," said march organizer Emmanuel Foulon.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>"We totally agree with the authorities' request to delay this plan for a later date.
