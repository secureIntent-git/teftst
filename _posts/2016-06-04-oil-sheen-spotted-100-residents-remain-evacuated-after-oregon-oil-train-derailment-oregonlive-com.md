		<p><em>UPDATE 11:48 a.m: The morning news conference has ended, but you can view footage in its entirety below.<br/></em></p>
<p>A light oil sheen was spotted in the Columbia River near the site of <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2016/06/oil_train_derails_near_hood_ri.html">Friday's oil train derailment</a> near the Oregon town of Mosier, raising concerns about the fiery wreck's environmental impacts during peak spring chinook migration.</p>
<p>Environmental officials said the oil has been contained and they are investigating the source.</p>
<p>Crews overnight put out the blaze in the tanker cars, and <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2016/06/interstate_84_reopens_after_oi.html">Interstate 84 was re-opened</a> to traffic. But about 100 people remained under evacuation from 74 homes.</p>
<p>Other disruptions continued for residents of Mosier, where exits to the interstate remained closed. Residents can't shower, use the toilet or let any water go down their drains. They've been told to boil tap water before drinking it.</p>
<p>The damage, Mayor Arlene Burns said early Saturday, could have been much worse. But still, "It's only so long you can go without flushing your toilet."</p>
<p>She said Mosier Manor, a trailer park near the site of the derailment, was still evacuated Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Wasco County Sheriff Lane Magill said deputies are patrolling the area and allowing residents to travel escorted to their homes if they need to fetch belongings such as medications.</p>
<p>"We're making sure that everybody's homes and property stay safe," Magill said.</p>
<p>He said the evacuation orders would be re-evaluated Saturday evening.</p>
<p>On the Columbia, cleanup crews early Saturday spotted the sheen about six feet offshore, outside of existing containment booms that were set up in Rock Creek, which feeds the river, said Judy Smith, a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency spokeswoman.</p>
<p>"The sheen is contained, but we want to know where it's coming from," Smith said. "It didn't come from Rock Creek. We're going to look for the source."<br/> <br/>Smith said it was possible that the oil came from a sewer drain. The wreck happened near Mosier's sewage treatment plant. Another 1,000 feet of containment boom – a floating barrier used to contain oil spills – has been deployed at the Columbia, she said.</p>
<p>The tank car fire that sent a sweeping plume of black smoke across the river was extinguished by firefighters at 2 a.m., Smith said. Crews are now working to offload oil from four of the derailed cars, she said, which will help officials determine how much spilled.</p>
<p>The derailment, west of the Columbia River Gorge city of 440, sent a billowing cloud of black smoke into the air, clogged traffic and frightened residents Friday. Fourteen cars from a 96-car Union Pacific train derailed west of the city early Friday afternoon — about 20 feet from the city's sewage plant and next to Rock Creek that feeds the Columbia River.</p>
<p>Four rail cars caught fire and at least one released oil. The fire appeared to be out early Saturday, but a small amount of lingering smoke persisted. </p>
<p>Mosier Fire Chief Jim Appleton said dousng the fire required a long process of cooling the tank cars before foam could be applied. He said crews poured on about 1,500 gallons of water per minute for eight to 10 hours.</p>
<p>At a news conference Saturday, Union Pacific spokeswoman Raquel Espinoza said the track where the derailment occurred undergoes inspection frequently. The most recent inspection as May 31.</p>
<p>"With all of these inspections there was nothing out of the ordinary," she said.</p>
<p>Espinoza said 16 cars at the scene would be removed on flatbed trucks after remaining oil is transferred to storage tanks.</p>
<p>Burns, the mayor, said the train was traveling slowly on a section of straight track at the time of the derailment. </p>
<p>"Last night I was wondering if all my earthly possessions would exist by the morning," she said. "We didn't know."</p>
<p>Burns said she's against oil and coal trains traveling through the gorge and said the derailment serves as a "wake up call" about the dangers of transporting oil.</p>
<p>"Hopefully this was a warning that fortunately didn't wipe out our entire town and our animals and everything that we own," she said.</p>
<p>This report will be updated.</p>
