<p>Have you been waiting hopelessly for <em>Zombieland 2</em>? As Jesse Eisenberg and Emma Stone become bigger and bigger stars, the possibility of that sequel happening becomes a longer shot all the time. But if a rip-roaring undead apocalypse is the kind of Halloween entertainment you crave then <em>Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse</em> will fill the hole in your dark heart.</p>
<p>A trio of lifelong friends and brothers in Scout arms think they’ve lucked out when they find a local strip club is without a bouncer to bar them from entry. But, wouldn’t you know, the only dancer on duty turns out to be <em>a goddamn zombie!</em> Panic, misadventure, and follies ensue. The shotgun-toting cocktail waitress looks like she’s going to be the scene-stealer here, but beyond the carnal fun we advise you to mind the lead actor in this movie, Tye Sheridan (aka our dark horse top choice to eventually play a young Han Solo in the revitalized <em>Star Wars</em> universe).</p>
<p>Remember when Miles Teller was in <em>Project X</em>, which came before his excellent turn in <em>The Spectacular Now</em> and right after his quietly lauded role in <em>Rabbit Hole</em>? If all goes as it should, we’re envisioning the same kind of trajectory for Sheridan: some very strong indie work (<em>Mud</em>, <em>The Stanford Prison Experiment</em>) that leads to exposure and therefore slightly bigger productions (see: <em>Scouts Guide</em>) that in turn builds his momentum as he moves towards blockbuster fare (he’ll be the new Scott Summers in <em>X-Men: Apocalypse</em>) that finally leads to meatier scripts with bigger actors (possibly his upcoming project <em>The Yellow Birds</em>, which stars Benedict Cumberbatch). Sheridan is very talented and has a nose for interesting scripts. So keep your eyes on this one starting now—if you don’t already.</p>
<p>But for now, it’s zombies! Grab a Twinkie and a Louisville Slugger because we’re in for a rough ride. And mind the content, because this is surely NSFW.</p>
<p><strong>Pause at:</strong> 1:07, because waitresses have surely endured worse than a zombiepocalypse. Zombie cats, an under-represented minority, at 1:19. A different kind of chest-bursting at 2:05.<br/><strong>Song:</strong> M.O.P., <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=un0RtP2KQ88" target="_blank">“Ante Up”</a><br/><strong>Essential Quote:</strong> “All right, Scouts. Let’s kick some zombie ass!”—Ben (Sheridan)</p>
