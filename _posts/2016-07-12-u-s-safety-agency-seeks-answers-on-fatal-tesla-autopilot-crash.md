<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">WASHINGTON</span> U.S. highway safety regulators have demanded that Tesla Motors Inc (<span id="symbol_TSLA.O_0">TSLA.O</span>) hand over detailed information about the design, operation and testing of its Autopilot technology following a May 7 fatal crash in which the system was in use.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), investigating an accident that has increased scrutiny of automated driving technology, also wants to know what Tesla investigators have learned about the crash.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>A nine-page letter from the agency dated July 8 was made public Tuesday. It requires the Palo Alto-based automaker to file responses in the coming weeks. Some answers are due by July 29 and others by Aug. 26.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Joshua Brown, a 40-year-old former Navy Seal from Ohio, was killed when his vehicle, operating on Autopilot in Florida, drove under a tractor trailer. It was first known fatality to involve a Model S operating on the Autopilot system that takes control of steering and braking. [nL1N19T1FF]</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The agency is seeking details of all design changes and updates to Autopilot since it went into use last year, and information on whether Tesla plans updates in the next four months.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>It also wants records of how many times the system told drivers to put their hands on the wheel and how often that led to the car automatically reducing vehicle power.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Other questions include what Autopilot does when cameras and sensors aren't working properly, how the system was tested, and how it filters out "false positive events and interventions."</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>The NHTSA sends such letters as a part of its safety investigations. Tesla declined to comment on the letter. Its stock was little changed at $224.47 on Tuesday.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday that Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said the company has no plans to disable Autopilot in the wake of the crash. [nL4N19Y4JV]</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>RECORDS AND DATA LOGS</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>When Tesla launched Autopilot in October, it said the system would allow the vehicle "to steer within a lane, change lanes with the simple tap of a turn signal, and manage speed by using active, traffic-aware cruise control."</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>But it added a disclaimer in a blog post that "the driver is still responsible for, and ultimately in control of, the car."</p><span id="midArticle_13"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>In its letter, NHTSA said it wants records and data logs of all crashes that could be linked to the software and the version of Autopilot in use of the time.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>It disclosed that Tesla and NHTSA officials met on June 14 -- two weeks before the agency opened a formal investigation. Tesla has said it informed NHTSA of the crash on May 16.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>NHTSA spokesman Bryan Thomas reiterated that the agency "has not made any determination about the presence or absence of a defect in the subject vehicles."</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>Tesla, in a blog post late last month about the accident, described Autopilot as being in a "public beta phase" and said it required customers to acknowledge that before activating the system's features. </p><span id="midArticle_1"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>In a July 10 tweet, Musk wrote that what "beta" means for Tesla is "any system w (with) less than 1B miles of real world driving."</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>NHTSA said last week it is reviewing another crash in Pennsylvania in which the driver reportedly said he was using Autopilot.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>On Tuesday, the Pennsylvania State Police said the Tesla driver, Albert Scaglione of Farmington Hills, Michigan, was charged with careless driving.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>In a statement last Wednesday about the Pennsylvania crash, Tesla said "based on the information we have now, we have no reason to believe that Autopilot had anything to do with this accident."</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Tesla also said on Monday that it was looking into a third crash involving a Model X in Montana.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>In that crash, the driver said Autopilot was engaged when the car slammed into 13 guardrails, said Montana State Trooper Jade Shope. The driver - on a trip from Seattle - was issued an $85 ticket for careless driving. Shope said he has not been able to confirm whether Autopilot was engaged.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Separately, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether Tesla waited too long to disclose the crash, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing an unnamed source. [nL4N19X4SX]</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Tesla said it has not heard from the SEC.  </p><span id="midArticle_9"/></div>
