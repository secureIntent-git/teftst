                            <p><b>CRUZ CATCHES MITT: </b>With more of a whimper than a bang, the 2012 GOP nominee has made his preference clear. As <i>POLITICO’s Nolan D. McCaskill reports </i><b>MITT ROMNEY </b>declared he would be caucusing for <b>TED CRUZ </b>on Tuesday in Utah’s primary — an endorsement, of sorts. </p>
<p>The former Massachusetts governor said he believes no one will win the nomination outright by accruing the necessary 1,237 delegates, which would lead to multiple ballots at a contested convention. “At this stage, the only way we can reach an open convention is for Senator Cruz to be successful in as many of the remaining nominating elections as possible,” Romney said in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mittromney/posts/10153370698696121" target="_blank">Facebook post</a>.</p><p class="story-continued">Story Continued Below</p>

 <p>The primary has whittled from a 17-person field to just front-runner Donald Trump, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Cruz. But the way Romney put it, the GOP primary is a battle between “Trumpism” and Republicanism. Trumpism, according to Romney, is about racism, misogyny, bigotry, xenophobia, vulgarity, threats and violence. “I am repulsed by each and every one of these,” he said. More here: <a href="http://politi.co/1ZaJjPL" target="_blank">http://politi.co/1ZaJjPL</a> </p>
<p>Romney’s post comes as others, particularly GOP megadonors, ponder whether an anti-Trump campaign is even feasible. <i>POLITICO’s Alex Isenstadt reports </i>that Trump adversaries are “dazed and demoralized.</p>
<p>They also, “find themselves at a defining moment: After unloading millions of dollars in attack ads aimed at destroying the real estate mogul, after the party’s 2012 nominee delivered a no-holds barred speech targeting him, and after conservatives far and wide spoke out in unrelenting terms about how he could never be president, he’s more dominant than ever.” More here: <a href="http://politi.co/1RU78Wk" target="_blank">http://politi.co/1RU78Wk</a> </p>

<p><b>TRAIL MIX:</b> <i>In today’s campaign news, <b>HILLARY CLINTON </b>has a white male problem. <b>BERNIE SANDERS </b>has a momentum problem. <b>DONALD TRUMP </b>has, potentially, a hacking problem. <b>TED CRUZ</b> picks up a lukewarm endorsement, <b>JOHN KASICH </b>may be a wrecking ball and Tom Perez has almost nothing to say about VP speculation. </i></p>
<p><b>THE DAILY CLINTON</b></p>
<p><b>BATTLE PLANS: </b><i>POLITICO Magazine </i>has an interesting feature — and an awesome graphic — with ideas from a top GOP strategist and top Democratic strategist for how <b>DONALD TRUMP </b>and <b>HILLARY CLINTON </b>can win and lose in November. <a href="http://politi.co/1Mqulhg" target="_blank">http://politi.co/1Mqulhg</a> </p>
<p><b>FORGET (WHITE) MEN: </b><i>The New York Times </i>looks at a demographic slow to embrace <b>HILLARY CLINTON </b>in Democratic primaries — white men. “While Mrs. Clinton swept the five major primaries on Tuesday, she lost white men in all of them, and by double-digit margins in Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio, exit polls showed — a sharp turnabout from 2008.” <a href="http://nyti.ms/21yougO" target="_blank">http://nyti.ms/21yougO</a> </p>
<p><b>GOOD TIMING: HILLARY CLINTON </b>picked up the endorsement of Arizona’s largest newspaper, the <i>Arizona Republic </i>which said of her, “Few Democrats are as battle-tested. She’s earned the nomination.” <a href="http://bit.ly/22s58fE" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/22s58fE</a> </p>
<p><b>BERRY BAD: </b><i>CNET </i>reports the National Security Agency shut <b>HILLARY CLINTON </b>down when she appealed for a Blackberry-like smartphone. “Clinton repeatedly tried to get her hands on "BlackBerry-like communications," but was denied by the National Security Agency out of concerns for security and cost … Emails … show that Clinton demanded access to the same type of secure BlackBerry device used by President Obama, and the NSA's subsequent rebuffs often led to heated exchanges between the two camps.” <a href="http://cnet.co/1WwCDda" target="_blank">http://cnet.co/1WwCDda</a> <br/></p>

<p><b>THE PROGRESSIVE RESISTANCE</b></p>
<p><b>REIGNITING THE BERN: </b><i>POLITICO’s Daniel Strauss reports </i>Tuesday’s thumping by <b>HILLARY CLINTON </b>is having a hangover effect on <b>BERNIE SANDERS, </b>a state he hoped would rejuvenate his push for the nomination. “Sanders already had a formidable task ahead of him in Arizona, where Clinton won 13 of the state’s 15 counties in her victory over Barack Obama in 2008 and the state’s sizable Hispanic population worked to her advantage.” <a href="http://politi.co/1ptoUca" target="_blank">http://politi.co/1ptoUca</a></p>
<p><b>AR-POW: </b><i>CBS </i>reports <b>BERNIE SANDERS </b>spent a rally in Flagstaff, Ariz., calling out <b>DONALD TRUMP’s </b>top supporter, anti-immigration Sheriff Joe Arpaio. "It's easy for bullies like Sheriff Arpaio to pick on people who have no power," Sanders said of Arpaio, a Trump backer the billionaire frequently references in his stump speech. "If I am elected president, the president of the United States does have power. So watch out, Joe." <a href="http://cbsn.ws/1TUjaoV" target="_blank">http://cbsn.ws/1TUjaoV</a> </p>
<p><b>ARPAIO AMBUSH: </b><i>Huffington Post </i>reports <b>BERNIE SANDERS </b>was aghast that Sheriff Joe Arpaio “ambushed” his wife, Jane Sanders, at an event in Arizona: <a href="http://huff.to/1Rrqq4Y" target="_blank">http://huff.to/1Rrqq4Y</a> </p>
<p><b>SPEAKING TRUTH TO POWER: </b><i>Gawker </i>is absolutely on point: <b>BERNIE SANDERS </b>said Washington’s professional football team is good. <i>The Blast </i>knows this to be patently false: <a href="http://bit.ly/1RplK5Y" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/1RplK5Y</a> </p>
<p><b>ON HIS OR HER OWN MERRICKS: BERNIE SANDERS </b>said — if Republicans kill Judge Merrick Garland’s Supreme Court nomination — he’ll appoint someone else, <i>Marketwatch </i>reports. <a href="http://on.mktw.net/1RoE0fB" target="_blank">http://on.mktw.net/1RoE0fB</a> </p>
<p><b>NOT AIPACING: </b><i>POLITICO’s Eliza Collins </i>reports <b>BERNIE SANDERS </b>sent his regrets to AIPAC, a pro-Israel lobbying group. He’ll be campaigning instead: <a href="http://politi.co/21zHviT" target="_blank">http://politi.co/21zHviT</a> </p>
<p><b>TRUMP ON THE STUMP</b> </p>
<p><b>OMINOUS ANONYMOUS: </b><i>Re/Code </i>reports the so-called hacktivists at Anonymous, which have promised to target <b>DONALD TRUMP, </b>have begun to target the real estate mogul “The group posted to Pastebin, a site that <a href="http://recode.net/2015/02/28/lessons-of-the-sony-hack-anybodys-vulnerable-video/" target="_blank">Sony’s hackers</a> used for distributing information stolen from the film studio, to publish extensive details about Trump — including what purports to be his home address, social security number, birth certificate and phone numbers.” <a href="http://on.recode.net/1XB1A7p" target="_blank">http://on.recode.net/1XB1A7p</a> Meanwhile, <i>POLITICO’s Nick Gass </i>reports Secret Service is looking into it: <a href="http://politi.co/1VkoXDC" target="_blank">http://politi.co/1VkoXDC</a> </p>
<p><b>THREATS INVESTIGATED: </b><i>Washington Post </i>reports New York police are looking into a suspicious package sent to <b>DONALD TRUMP’s </b>son, Eric. “Police were called by security personnel at Eric Trump's Manhattan apartment just after 7 p.m. Thursday, to investigate an envelope that contained a powdered substance.” <a href="http://wapo.st/1S88Xlk" target="_blank">http://wapo.st/1S88Xlk</a> </p>
<p><b>METAPHORICAL ‘RIOTS’: </b><i>USA Today </i>talks to <b>CHRIS CHRISTIE, </b>who says <b>DONALD TRUMP </b>was talking figuratively when he wondered aloud about “riots” if he’s not confirmed as the GOP nominee. <a href="http://usat.ly/1pQRLYq" target="_blank">http://usat.ly/1pQRLYq</a> </p>
<p><b>TED’S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE</b></p>
<p><b>FAMILIAR REFRAIN: </b><i>POLITICO’s Nick Gass reports </i><b>DONALD TRUMP </b>took to Twitter before heading to Utah — to argue that Mormons shouldn’t vote for <b>TED CRUZ </b>because he lies. Yup: <a href="http://http//politi.co/1nVmVwf" target="_blank">http://http://politi.co/1nVmVwf</a> </p>
<p><b>HOUSE MONEY: </b><i>CNN </i>reports <b>TED CRUZ </b>will gather his donors in Las Vegas for a summit on the path forward for him and to plot strategy. <a href="http://cnn.it/1R9goq0" target="_blank">http://cnn.it/1R9goq0</a> </p>
<p><b>ANOTHER GRAMM: </b><i>The New York Times </i>reports former Sen. Phil Gramm — an establishment sort of guy — is backing <b>TED CRUZ</b>. <a href="http://nyti.ms/1Msiejy" target="_blank">http://nyti.ms/1Msiejy</a> </p>
<p><b>KASICH’S CASE</b></p>
<p><b>HEADING WEST: </b><i>Fox 13 </i>reports <b>JOHN KASICH </b>hit a round of events in Utah, where he made the case that he can win the nomination at the GOP convention: <a href="http://trib.in/1R3Z09o" target="_blank">http://trib.in/1R3Z09o</a> </p>
<p><b>WRECKING BALL?: </b>In <i>Bloomberg View </i>Jonathan Bernstein argues that <b>JOHN KASICH </b>is not so much an establishment savior as a wrecking ball swinging towards the whole GOP: “Serious presidential candidates normally leave the race when they no longer have a chance to win.” <a href="http://bv.ms/1RU3aNu" target="_blank">http://bv.ms/1RU3aNu</a> </p>
<p><b>SURVEYING THE 2016 LANDSCAPE</b></p>
<p><b>IXNAY ON THE VEEPAY: </b>Labor Secretary Tom Perez did not say “yes” or “no” when pressed about whether he would serve as <b>HILLARY CLINTON’s </b>vice president, as has been buzzed about. Instead, he offered a popular platitude about “making every day count.” <i>POLITICO’s Nick Gass </i>wraps it up: <a href="http://politi.co/21z0jij" target="_blank">http://politi.co/21z0jij</a> </p>
