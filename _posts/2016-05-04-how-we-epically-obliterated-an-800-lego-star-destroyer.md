<br><div id="start-of-content"><p>Last year on Star Wars Day, the crew of <em>Battle Damage</em> released a video of a gigantic $800 Lego Star Destroyer getting <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/05/lego-super-star-destroyer-destroyed/" target="_blank"> completely obliterated</a>. In slow motion. It was wildly popular and got more than 4 million views <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN_AMSlNocE" target="_blank">on YouTube</a>. But at the time, they didn’t really reveal how it was done. This year for May the Fourth, that wrong is being righted. Check out the process of destroying the Destroyer in the video above. It’s got everything, including the 1,000 frames-per-second Phantom camera and 20 mph custom cart built to capture the epic crash.  </p>
