Zuckerberg's said in December that he intends to put 99 percent of his Facebook shares into a new philanthropy project focusing on human potential and equality.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The lawsuit contends that a Facebook board committee which approved the share deal "did not bargain hard" with Zuckerberg "to obtain anything of meaningful value" in exchange for granting Zuckerberg added control.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>

Facebook will issue two of the so-called "Class C" shares for each outstanding Class A and Class B share held by shareholders. Those new Class C shares will be publicly traded under a new symbol.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Zuckerberg "wishes to retain this power, while selling off large amounts of his stockholdings, and reaping billions of dollars in proceeds," the lawsuit said.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>"The issuance of the Class C stock will, in effect, have the same effect as a grant to Zuckerberg of billions of dollars in equity, for which he will pay nothing," it said.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Google settled a lawsuit in 2013 shortly before trial which cleared the way for that company to execute a similar plan. </p><span id="midArticle_9"/><span id="midArticle_10"/><p> (Reporting by Dan Levine; Editing by Bernard Orr and Tom Brown)</p><span id="midArticle_11"/></div>
