        <p><strong>While timing, precipitation type, and accumulations are still in question, confidence is increasing that a significant winter storm will impact New Jersey this weekend.</strong></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-585883" src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Weekend-winter-storm-update-Nasty-weather-likely-for-NJ-New-Jersey-1015-FM-Radio.png" alt="Winter Storm 20160119" width="630" height="420"/></p>
<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
<p>The threat of a significant winter storm is increasing, in the Friday afternoon to Saturday evening time frame. Some combination of heavy snow, heavy rain, damaging winds, and moderate to major coastal flooding will make for prolonged nasty conditions in New Jersey. It is still too early to produce a detailed forecast, as significant questions have yet to be resolved regarding the exact storm track, timing, temperature profile, and snow accumulation potential.</p>
<h3>Short-Term Forecast</h3>
<p>Yes, everyone is thinking about and talking about the weekend storm. And researching the forecast has taken up about 95% of my life over the past few days. However, it’s in my job description that I have to include some sort of short-range forecast in my daily blog. So here you go …</p>
<p>It’s cold! Tuesday will be similar to Monday overall. Morning wind chills are near zero, and will only improve to the teens by this afternoon. Thermometers will only climb to the 26 to 32 degree range across the state today.</p>
<p>Winds finally calm down on Wednesday, under partly sunny skies. Highs will bump into the mid 30s – still a bit below normal for mid-to-late January.</p>
<p>On Thursday morning, we could see a few light snow showers as a weak wave pushes through New Jersey. (Although this morning’s models show these showers to be a fizzle.) Skies will become sunny again on Thursday, with highs again in the mid 30s.</p>
<p>And then clouds increase on Friday ahead of a strong low pressure approaching from the southwest. That’s the system that will probably bring nasty weather to the Garden State starting Friday afternoon and through most of the day on Saturday.</p>
<h3>Why Can’t You Just Tell Me the Forecast?</h3>
<p>In <a href="http://nj1015.com/cold-blustery-and-potentially-wintry-weather-this-week-in-new-jersey/">yesterday’s blog</a>, I joked that the forecast called for anywhere from 0 to 25 inches of snow. <b>There is still little model-to-model consistency at this time, so it is still impossible to give a definitive, detailed forecast.</b> Here are some of the biggest reasons why:</p>
<p><b>Sampling.</b> The low pressure system behind our winter weather threat is still thousands of miles away, over the Pacific Ocean. That’s a problem. Our computer forecast models are incredibly hungry for data specifically from the upper atmosphere to make a weather forecast. Most of the highest quality data input into these models come from the twice-daily weather balloon launches at about 100 sites across the country. Unfortunately, there are no weather balloons over the ocean. So the quality of our forecast model output is currently weak. Once we have a better sampling of the energy swirling around in this system, we can present a more confident and accurate forecast.</p>
<p><b>Storm Track.</b> The exact track the storm takes up the Atlantic coast is <i>everything</i> in this forecast. If New Jersey ends up on the left side of the storm, our precipitation will be mostly snow. If we end up right under the center of the track, our forecast will include a complicated mix of heavy snow and rain. If the storm tracks further out to sea, it would turn into a mostly wet forecast. If the track of the storm leads to prevailing northerly winds, the coastal flooding threat will be minimized. But if winds are out of the northeast or east (from the ocean), the Jersey Shore may be in trouble. This is a perfect example of The Butterfly Effect – a great movie, by the way, and an illustration of the chaos theory that dictates the workings of our atmosphere. The closer the storm gets, the fewer potential paths it may ultimately take. And therefore, the more confident we are that any “wiggle” in the storm track will be minor or insignificant.</p>
<p><b>Temperatures.</b> Among the major long-range models, the European has consistently shown a colder forecast than the GFS and Canadian. That would, of course, lead to a snowier forecast with higher accumulations. However, during the storm on Saturday, our official high temperature forecast for New Jersey ranges from 28 to 40 degrees. Yes, 40 degrees — too warm to support all-snow! In fact, coastal and southern New Jersey in particular are prone to see a period of rain or wintry mix at some point. That would, of course, lead to dramatically lower snow totals wherever it rains. Forecasting the location of the rain-snow line at any given time during this storm’s evolution is going to be tricky (and almost impossible). The difference of just a few degrees over just a few miles could lead to a snowfall difference of many inches (or even feet).</p>
<h3>Could It Be a Bust?</h3>
<p>Well, I’m not ready to rule out a complete bust (i.e. no big snow totals) from this system — but you can probably tell by the language I’m using on-air and online, a “nothing” scenario is rapidly becoming unlikely.</p>
<p>For several days in a row, every major forecast model has shown this system to have a significant impact on New Jersey. (Again, by significant impact, I mean some combination of heavy snow, heavy rain, strong winds, and/or coastal flooding.) There is a preponderance of evidence suggesting that our weather will probably get downright nasty this weekend. (Hence, the headline of this article.) But because we’re still not sure <i>what</i> is going to happen <i>where</i> and to <i>what degree</i>, it’s still premature to use hyperbole to describe this storm as “historic” or a “blizzard” or “snowmageddon”, etc. (I’m looking at you, “social media-rologists.”)</p>
<p>I laid out several concerns above with the going forecast – specifically, above-freezing temperatures forcing a changeover from snow to rain for part of the storm’s evolution, and not knowing much about the storm’s exact makeup yet. I expect that we’ll gain some resolution on these issues over the next day or two – when we know something new, you’ll be the first to know!</p>
