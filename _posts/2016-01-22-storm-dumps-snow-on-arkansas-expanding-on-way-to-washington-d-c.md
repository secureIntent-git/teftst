Southeastern Pennsylvania, including Philadelphia, was expecting 10 to 16 inches (25 to 42 cm) of snow.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Governors of Arkansas and Tennessee ordered state offices closed on Friday, as the storm barreled across their states and Kentucky. It dropped 5 inches (13 cm) of snow in Arkansas and a wintry mess of snow, sleet and freezing rain across northern Tennessee and south-central Kentucky, Petersen said.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>"It's expanding and coming east," he said. "It will continue to grow as it crosses the mid-Atlantic states, where Maryland, southeastern Pennsylvania and northern Virginia will get the heaviest snow."</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Across the Southeast, government offices, schools and universities were shuttered on Friday.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Millions of residents in the storm's path scrambled to prepare, picking stores clean of bottled water, food and other supplies.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Federal employees in the Washington area were told their offices would close at noon on Friday to allow them to get home safely before the snow begins piling up in the afternoon.  Public schools were canceled.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which includes the second-busiest U.S. subway system, took the rare step of suspending operations from late on Friday through Sunday.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>The Virginia National Guard said it planned to bring in up to 300 troops to assist in response operations.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>CANCELED FLIGHTS</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>

Philadelphia's airport said it would cancel all flights scheduled for Saturday.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio urged motorists to stay off roads starting on Friday amid icy and whiteout conditions.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Bowser on Friday said the nation's capital was better prepared for the coming storm than it was for the sudden snowfall that left scores of motorists - including President Barack Obama - battling gridlock Wednesday night. </p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>"We can and will do better for this storm. Even with that, this is a historic storm and so we're putting all of our resources at it," she said on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" program.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Given the extraordinary conditions expected, the city has been preparing all week for the type of blizzard that Bowser said the Washington has not seen in 90 years.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>AccuWeather senior meteorologist Alex Sosnowski said the storm taking aim at Washington could bring one of the biggest snowfalls on record, eclipsing the "Snowmageddon" storm of 2010 that dropped 17.8 inches (45.2 cm).</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The largest snowstorm recorded in Washington was the 1922 Knickerbocker storm, which buried the city under 28 inches (71 cm).</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The storm was due to miss northern New England and in Bangor, Maine, which sees 4 feet (1.2 m) of snow in a typical winter, police took to social media to advise residents of the mid-Atlantic region on how to prepare for a blizzard.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>"Don't panic. It's just frozen rain," the police department said on its Facebook page. "DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT buy all the bread on the shelves. As a lifelong Mainer, I recommend cereal."</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><span id="midArticle_6"/><p> (Additional reporting by <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=scott.malone&amp;">Scott Malone</a> in Boston, Colleen Jenkins in Winston-Salem, N.C., Suzannah Gonzales in Chicago, Barbara Goldberg in New York and Victoria Cavaliere in Los Angeles; Editing by <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=bill.trott&amp;">Bill Trott</a>)</p><span id="midArticle_7"/></div>
