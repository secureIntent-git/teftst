Here are the night's biggest moments you may have missed:</p><p><strong>1. Taylor Swift, accepting album of the year, calls out Kanye West.</strong></p><p>Less than a week after West drew backlash for his song <em>Famous</em>, in which he suggested that he made Swift famous by crashing the stage during her 2009 MTV Video Music Awards acceptance speech, the pop star indirectly responded to his diss. Accepting album of the year for her blockbuster <em>1989</em>, Swift took a moment to address "the young women out there.</p><p>"There are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success, or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame," Swift said. "But if you just focus on the work and you don't let those people sidetrack you, someday, when you get where you're going, you'll look around and you will know that it was you and the people who love you who put you there, and that will be the greatest feeling in the world."</p><p><strong>2. Lady Gaga pays tribute to David Bowie. </strong></p><p>Bowie, who died of cancer last month at 69, got the Grammys salute he deserved thanks to a decades-spanning medley from Lady Gaga. Just one week after singing <em>The Star-Spangled Banner</em> at the Super Bowl, the pop star threw herself into a marathon set that included classics such as <em>Space Oddity</em>, <em>Changes</em>, <em>Rebel Rebel</em> and <em>Let's Dance</em>. Rocking a bright orange wig and sporting costumes from Bowie's Ziggy Stardust and Thin White Duke eras, the vibrant performance culminated in a rousing rendition of <em>Heroes</em>, joined by Chic's Nile Rodgers on guitar.</p><p><strong>3. Kendrick Lamar delivers a fiery performance. </strong></p><p>The Compton, Calif., rapper earned five Grammys, including best rap album for <em>To Pimp a Butterfly</em>, but he also won high praise for his impassioned performance midway through the show. In a medley from <em>Butterfly</em>, Lamar donned handcuffs and a prison uniform for a saxophone-assisted take on <em>The Blacker the Berry</em>, before dancing in front of a large bonfire with African dancers for Black Lives Matter anthem Alright. He finished by rapping new material with ferocious intensity in closeup, before the performance ended as he stood in front of a black-and-white Compton map, bathed in silhouette.</p><p><strong>4. Adele endures sound, vocal issues. </strong></p><p>Even the Queen has an off night. Bathed in a golden spotlight and accompanied only by piano, Adele sang <em>All I Ask</em>, co-written by Bruno Mars, from her record-smashing <em>25</em>. Unfortunately for the British singer, her first Grammys performance since 2012's <em>Rolling in the Deep</em> was plagued by faulty sound, which cut out intermittently. People on Twitter also docked the diva for her sometimes pitchy off-key vocals.</p><p><strong>5. Ariana Grande gets booed for The Weeknd introduction. </strong></p><p>The Staples Center crowd wasn't feeling Grande's attempt at humor. Introducing a medley by her <em>Love Me Harder</em> collaborator The Weeknd, the pop star joked, "How did this next performer land his seven nominations tonight, including album of the year and song of the year? Well, ladies and gentlemen, get ready for the pun of the century: He <em>Earned It</em>." Despite earning a mix of applause and boos, she laughed off the awkward moment and sang a few bars before the R&amp;B crooner took the stage.</p><p><strong>6. <em>Hamilton</em> doesn't throw away its shot. </strong></p><p>Not even <em>Late Show</em> host Stephen Colbert can nab tickets to sold-out Broadway sensation <em>Hamilton</em>. "The soonest I could get online was a Sunday matinee in 2018," he joked from New York's Richard Rodgers Theatre, where he later introduced creator/star Lin-Manuel Miranda and the cast of the hip-hop musical. Their electrifying performance of opening number <em>Alexander Hamilton </em>won raves on Twitter from fans, who soon after were enamored by Miranda's all-rhyming acceptance speech for best musical theater album.</p><p><strong>7. Stevie Wonder takes a stand for the disabled. </strong></p><p>Following a tribute to late Earth, Wind &amp; Fire co-founder Maurice White, Pentatonix and Stevie Wonder presented song of the year to Ed Sheeran (<em>Thinking Out Loud</em>). After struggling to open the envelope, Wonder held up the winning name (written in Braille) and jokingly taunted the audience. "You can't read it! You can't read Braille," he quipped, before turning serious. "We need to make every single thing accessible to every person with a disability."</p><p><strong>8. Rihanna, Lauryn Hill are no-shows. </strong></p><p>It was a tough night for R&amp;B fans. Rihanna was slated to perform <em>Kiss It Better</em> off her new album <em>Anti</em>, but canceled her performance after rehearsals at the Staples Center due to an upper-respiratory infection, according to her spokeswoman. Hill was also expected to do a joint performance with The Weeknd, although her camp released <a href="http://www.ew.com/article/2016/02/15/grammys-2016-lauryn-hill-weeknd?xid=entertainment-weekly_socialflow_twitter">a statement</a> to <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> saying that it was announced "prematurely" and "was never confirmed."</p><!-- cxenseparse_end --><p>Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1XuulmI</p></div>
