<p>Twenty-one Vietnamese asylum seekers have been intercepted approaching Australia by boat, processed at sea, and returned to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/vietnam" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag" class="u-underline">Vietnam</a>.</p>
<p>The boat, intercepted by the navy earlier this month in the Timor Sea, is the third from Vietnam to be intercepted by Australian authorities in the past 14 months.</p>
<p>Asylum seekers previously forcibly returned to Vietnam have been jailed despite assurances from the Australian and Vietnamese governments that they would not be prosecuted, persecuted or punished for attempting to reach Australia.</p>
<p>At least eight people have been jailed for organising boat journeys and trying to reach Australia.</p>
<aside class="element element-rich-link element-rich-link--not-upgraded" data-component="rich-link" data-link-name="rich-link-1 | 1" readability="0.28125"><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/26/vietnam-jails-four-asylum-seekers-returned-by-australia" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">Vietnam jails four asylum seekers returned by Australia</a> </p>
</aside><p>The immigration and border protection department has not commented on whether assurances were sought or received that people returned to Vietnam from the latest boat would not face persecution or prosecution.</p>
<p>The boat is the 28th known to have been turned back since the Coalition took office in 2013, and the first to arrive since the start of this election campaign. A boat of Sri Lankan Tamil asylum seekers reached the Cocos Islands, Australian territory, on 2 May, just days before the election was called.<br/></p>
<p>That was the last boat to make landfall in Australia. The prime minister’s claim that his government had “<a href="https://www.malcolmturnbull.com.au/media/visiting-the-australian-border-force-with-natasha-griggs-mp-in-darwin" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">had over 600 days without any unauthorised arrivals</a>” is not correct.</p>
<p>But the announcement of another intercept immediately became an election issue.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/peter-dutton" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag" class="u-underline">Peter Dutton</a>, the immigration minister, said Labor had a “caveat” in their turn-back policy, insisting that “they won’t do it in every instance”.</p>
<p>“They are saying not in every instance will they turn back a boat,” said Dutton. “They have been clear about that in their own language.</p>
<p>“There are three reasons why Operation Sovereign Borders has worked. First is turning back boats where it is safe to do so. And temporary protection visas and then regional processing.”</p>
<p>Only two caveats exist for the turn-back of boats: the government insists boats are only turned back “where it is safe to do so”; and Australia must also ensure, under the non-refoulement obligations of international law, that it does not return anybody to a place where their “<a href="http://www.unhcr.org/protect/PROTECTION/3b66c2aa10.pdf" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">life or freedom would be threatened</a>”.</p>
<p>Labor insists it has an identical policy on boat turn-backs to the current government, and that asylum was a “break glass” [in case of emergency] issue for the Coalition because it did not have any positive policies.</p>
<p>Dutton and Turnbull “should be ashamed of themselves, sending out a signal to people smugglers that there is a lack of national will to deter people smugglers”, Labor said, and insisted the party would turn back boats if it won power. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/24/vietnamese-asylum-seekers-forcibly-returned-by-australia-face-jail" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">Two boats from Vietnam, both carrying 46 asylum seekers</a>, were intercepted by Australian Border Force and navy vessels in April and July last year. In both cases, all on board were returned to Vietnam after being processed at sea.<br/></p>
<p>The commander of Operation Sovereign Borders, <a href="https://www.border.gov.au/about/operation-sovereign-borders/major-general-andrew-bottrell" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">Maj Gen Andrew Bottrell</a>, told Senate estimates in May the Australian government had been given “assurance” in writing by the Vietnamese government “<a href="https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2016/05/23/Legal_and_Constitutional_Affairs_Legislation_Committee_2015_05_25_3493_Official.pdf" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">that there would not be any retribution for their illegal departure from Vietnam</a>”.<br/></p>
<p>However, four people from each of the vessels were jailed, charged and prosecuted.</p>
<p>The UNHCR has repeatedly raised concerns about “enhanced screening”, which it says <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/53baa6ff6.html" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">breaches international law</a>.<br/></p>
<p>“UNHCR has previously made known its concerns to Australia about its enhanced screening procedures and their non-compliance with international law,” it said in 2014 after 41 Sri Lankans were returned.<br/></p>
<p>“UNHCR’s experience over the years with shipboard processing has generally not been positive. Such an environment would rarely afford an appropriate venue for a fair procedure.”</p>

<figcaption class="caption caption--img"><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/jun/20/paul-stevenson-on-australias-detention-regime-every-day-is-demoralising-video" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">Paul Stevenson on Australia’s immigration detention regime: ‘Every day is demoralising’</a>
</figcaption></figure><p>Paul Stevenson, the psychologist and trauma specialist who this week spoke out against what he described as the “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/20/the-worst-ive-seen-trauma-expert-lifts-lid-on-atrocity-of-australias-detention-regime" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">atrocity” of detention on Nauru and Manus</a>, has been fired for his comments. </p>
<p>Stevenson was previously awarded an Order of Australia by the government for his work in counselling victims of the Bali bombings. He was due to return to Nauru on Thursday.</p>
<p>Stevenson’s comments were supported by more than 2,000 pages of incident reports that detailed widespread assaults, sexual abuse, self-harm and suicide attempts in the island detention centres. He said “demoralisation” was the “paramount feature of offshore detention”.</p>
<p>“It’s indeterminate, it’s under terrible, terrible conditions, and there is nothing you can say about it that says there’s some positive humanity in this. And that’s why it’s such an atrocity.”</p>
<p>In response to questions from the Guardian about Stevenson’s comments, a spokesman for the immigration department said: “In keeping with caretaker provisions, noting that Paul Stevenson is currently running for public office as a senator, we refer you to .... previously published statements on these issues. The department has responded on multiple occasions to the allegations raised.</p>
<p>“The <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00650" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">ABF Act</a> <a href="http://newsroom.border.gov.au/releases/secrecy-provisions-of-the-australian-border-force-act" data-link-name="in body link" class="u-underline">does not prevent general statements</a> being made about conditions in detention centres; however the secrecy provisions within the act can apply to the disclosure of protected or classified information.”</p>
