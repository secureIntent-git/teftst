<br><div id=""><p>When Will Arnett first moved to Venice—aka “Menace”—California “there’d be gunshots so close that I’d grab the dog and go down on the ground,” the actor says. That was 16 years ago. Since then, the seaside LA town has gotten considerably quieter (read: bougier, beachier, and techier). When Google opened offices in Venice back in 2011, “it was the big news for a while,” Arnett says. “Everything’s gonna go up because everyone’s here from Google.” </p>
<p>That transformation forms the backdrop, thematically and literally, of Arnett’s new Netflix comedy, <em>Flaked</em>, which he developed with <em>Arrested Development</em> creator Mitch Hurliz. In it, Arnett plays Chip, a self-help guru who (naturally) needs some serious help himself. Another character on the show—Stefan (“Ste-FAHN”), a barista with anger-management issues—was named after a guy Arnett once knew in town. “We found out years later he used to be a Steven,” Arnett says. “Venice is the place you go to assume an entirely new identity.” </p>
<p>Feel like heading to Cali to find a new you? Let Arnett be your guide. Here are his tips for getting the most out of Venice. </p>
<h3>Prep the Right Books and Music</h3>
<p>“Read Jack Kerouac’s <em>On the Road</em> and embrace a freewheeling lifestyle … Indie rock is the soundtrack to my Venice—listen to Pavement, Built to Spill, anything like that … Stock up on Vans and flip-flops … Throw away your khakis.”</p>
<h3>The Boardwalk Is a Crapshoot, But Go Anyway</h3>
<p>“It’s always a real mixed bag—everything from European tourists to people from other parts of California coming up to the beach to an assortment of folks who live on the beach! There’s this guy in a turban who’s always playing his electric guitar with his amp strapped on his back and it’s super unmelodic and it pierces through everything and he’s on roller skates and he’s been there virtually every day for at least 20 years.”</p>
<h3>Take in the Cool in Abbot Kinney</h3>
<p>“Great stores, great coffee places. It’s the place that has really exemplified the commercial explosion of Venice. <a href="http://www.intelligentsiacoffee.com/location/venice-coffeebar" target="_blank">Intelligentsia Coffee</a> is, like, such a thing, there’s always this line—but the coffee is really good. I kind of hate myself because it is fantastic.”</p>
<h3>Make Sure to Eat at Gjelina…</h3>
<p>“My favorite thing to do is to go and have a late lunch at <a href="http://www.gjelina.com/" target="_blank">Gjelina</a>. It’s Italian. They make arguably the best pizza in LA. It’s sort of a thin crust, and not overly cheesy, just a lot of whatever kind of ingredients. You know, the perfect size, perfect taste.”</p>
<h3>…And/Or Get Sandwiches at GTA</h3>
<p>“Getting one of <a href="http://www.gjelinatakeaway.com/" target="_blank">GTA’s Vietnamese sandwiches</a> to go is about the greatest thing to do if you want to just grab a sandwich and walk the streets.”</p>
<h3>Seek Out Pop-Ups</h3>
<p>“There are a lot of pop-up shops. It’s got that ever-changing feel to it. Art galleries pop up every day. There are some incredible artists in Venice—painters, sculptors, actors, writers.” </p>
<h3>Imbibe at The Brig</h3>
<p>“The stalwart that’s been there forever. If you’re trying to decide where to go or what to do, you can always say, ‘Let’s just meet at <a href="http://www.thebrig.com/" target="_blank">The Brig</a> for a drink.'”</p>
<h3>Make Sure to Go Exploring on the Side Streets</h3>
<p>“There are so many great walk streets. Some are hidden, you don’t even know they’re there—narrow sidewalks, overgrown with greenery. And the houses are so different. You’ll have an old craftsman, and then you’ll have some new, gleaming architectural marvel—all side by side. It’s really interesting.” </p>
<h3>Stick to Two-Wheeled Transportation If You Can</h3>
<p>“I spend a lot of time riding my bike. It’s the greatest mode of transport. So much time is spent locked away in your car. There’s something about living in a community where everything is just a short bike ride away that makes me really happy on such a basic level.”</p>
<h3>Play Paddleball</h3>
<p>“There’s a whole community of people who play a lot, they have tournaments, they all know each other, and they have incredible arguments on the court. There’s always some kind of a drama playing out—whether it’s about reserving a court, or some old feud, or they’re like former doubles partners. Middle-aged guys wearing knee braces and elbow pads—just the craziest. And yet, they’re super awesome, and if you get down there and you want to get into it, you can just insert yourself in that world.”</p>
