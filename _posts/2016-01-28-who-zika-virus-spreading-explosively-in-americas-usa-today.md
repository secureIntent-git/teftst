In some cases, it can also attack the nervous system, causing paralysis.</p><p>"A causal relationship between Zika virus infection and birth defects and neurological syndromes has not been established, but is strongly suspected," WHO said in announcing the emergency meeting.</p><p>About a dozen Americans in a handful of states have been diagnosed with Zika after visiting outbreak zones, but there is no evidence the virus is spreading in the USA. The virus doesn't spread from person to person, like the flu. It's spread by mosquitoes, like malaria and West Nile Virus.</p><p>The Americas could see 3 million to 4 million Zika infections a year, said Sylvain Aldighieri, the unit chief for international health regulations epidemic alert and response for the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization. Aldighieri said that estimate is based on the fact that the Americas see 2 million cases a year of dengue fever, a virus spread by the same mosquito that spreads Zika virus.</p><p>The governments of several Latin American countries have advised women to postpone pregnancy. WHO officials said they would not be advising women on this issue. “Decisions about pregnancy are very personal,” said Bruce Aylward, assistant director-general of the WHO. Aylward did say that pregnant women should take precautions to avoid mosquito bites.</p><p>An American from <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/01/27/zika-virus-confirmed-minnesota-resident-who-traveled-central-america/79425194/">Minnesota tested positive</a> for the virus after traveling to Central America, state health officials announced Wednesday.The mosquito species that is known to spread Zika, the Aedes, doesn't live in Minnesota, however, making it unlikely the disease will spread in that state.</p><p>The WHO  announcement comes one day after doctors <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleID=2485361">writing in <em>The Journal of the American Medical Association</em></a> criticized the organization's response to what it said was a disease with “explosive pandemic potential" with outbreaks in Africa, Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, and the Americas.</p><p>The doctors said "the global dimensions of Zika are quite clear, with fresh urgency as the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro loom."</p><p>Chan had pledged sweeping reforms in the 68-year-old agency after its handling of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa three years ago. She admitted afterward that WHO had been unprepared for the epidemic.</p><p>WHO said it already supports increasing the surveillance systems in countries that have reported Zika and said that may be increased in the coming weeks.The organization said it will also focus on new vaccines and ways to control the mosquito population, which transmits the virus.</p><p>Lawrence Gostin, director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown, praised the WHO's decision to schedule an emergency meeting, calling it "a critical first step in recognizing the seriousness of an emerging epidemic."</p><p>He also called on WHO to urgently mobilize international resources to curb the rapid spread of Zika worldwide, including aggressive mosquito control, active surveillance, accelerated vaccine research and travel advisories for pregnant women.</p><p>"It is far better to be over-prepared than to wait until a Zika epidemic spins out of control," said Gostin, one of the two authors of the JAMA report. "If the association between microcephaly and Zika virus is confirmed, there will be an ethical imperative to protect women of childbearing age from contracting the infection. The public will demand well-funded, proactive leadership from the World Health Organization.”</p><p>The new U.S. case was diagnosed in a woman in her 60s from Anoka County, Minn., according to the <a href="http://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/MNMDH/bulletins/132c6d2">Minnesota Department of Health</a>. Her symptoms began Jan. 1, after she returned from Honduras. She was not hospitalized and is expected to make a full recovery, health officials said.</p><p>About 80% of people infected with Zika virus have no symptoms at all, according to WHO. Those who do become ill tend to have mild symptoms, including a low fever, rash, joint pain, headache and pink eye.</p><p>Scientists have a number of key questions about Zika and why its emergence in Brazil has coincided with the spike in microcephaly, or abnormal small head sizes, and why these birth defects have increased in Brazil but not in other countries.</p><p>Aylward, the WHO assistant director-genera, noted that Brazil is contending with multiple outbreaks of disease spread by the same mosquitoes, the Aedes species, including dengue and chikungunya, which both cause fevers and joint pain. Aylward said doctors are looking into whether Zika becomes more dangerous if people are also infected with the other mosquito-borne diseases, or if people have been infected with these diseases in the past.</p><p>After the latest reports of the virus, all three of the USA's biggest airlines are allowing some customers to cancel or postpone their trips if they’re ticketed to fly to areas affected by Zika.  American, United and Delta each made the move this week amid rising concerns about the mosquito-borne virus.</p><p><em>Contributing: Ben Mutzabaugh</em></p><!-- cxenseparse_end --><p>Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1SLXH0h</p></div>
