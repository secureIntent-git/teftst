					<p>Satirizing Donald Trump’s tweets is so beloved an Internet pastime that Twitter teems with parody accounts doing it. We’ve rounded up some of our favorites, so dive right in for snark, D&amp;D, and combover humor. And remember, none of this would be possible without <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump" target="_blank">@realDonaldTrump</a> for inspiration. Sad!</p>
