The company also said it would fund research of a tool that scans content and flags images, audio and video.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>"We will consider terrorist content to be material posted by or in support of organizations included on the Consolidated United Nations Security Council Sanctions List that depicts graphic violence, encourages violent action, endorses a terrorist organization or its acts, or encourages people to join such groups," the blog post said.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The steps illustrate the tough predicament many companies face balancing public safety with individual rights. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The issue came to the fore after Apple Inc. and the U.S. government clashed over whether federal authorities could force Apple to create software to unlock a phone used by a shooter in the San Bernardino attacks last year.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Ultimately, the government paid a third party to unlock the phone.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
