        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>As of Friday, they were also among the top five mentioned brands at event venues on Facebook Inc's photo-sharing app Instagram, according to data from Ground Signal, a location-based social media search company.  </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Engaging with users of social media is increasingly important to designers because it helps them draw attention of consumers, not only buyers and press who attend the show.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The strategy is also a way to reach younger fans. According to Ground Signal, roughly a third of Instagram posts were from users under the age of 25. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>“We know we need to be where our customer is, and today she is on all of these platforms consuming more content more quickly than ever before,” Lisa Pomerantz, a Michael Kors spokeswoman, said by email. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Chatter on social media sites can drive demand for designers' collections. Rebecca Minkoff, a maker of luxury handbags and clothing, promoted designs on several platforms under the hashtag #SeeBuyWear. Its New York-based store did four times its usual business following Saturday's show, a Minkoff spokeswoman said in an email.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Major fashion houses did not receive the same level of attention as widely known music artists with their own fashion lines. According to Amobee, rapper Kanye West's Yeezy line drew more than 800,000 tweets, and singer Rihanna's Fenty x Puma collection brought in over 140,000, topping the list when it came to Twitter traffic.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Other brands with significant Twitter mentions included PVH Corp's Tommy Hilfiger, Malan Breton and Coach Inc.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><span id="midArticle_12"/><p> (Editing by Anjali Athavaley and Cynthia Osterman)</p><span id="midArticle_13"/></div>
