<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="6"><p><span class="articleLocation">ROME/SYDNEY</span> Australian Cardinal George Pell, the highest-ranking Vatican official to testify on systemic sexual abuse of children by clergy in the Roman Catholic Church, said on Monday that he has the full backing of Pope Francis.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Pell on Sunday told Australia's Royal Commission into Institutional Response to Child Sexual Abuse that the church made "enormous mistakes" and "catastrophic" choices by attempting to cover up abuses in the 1970s. </p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Pell's testimony has received global coverage. Because of his high position in the Vatican, the Australian inquiry into sexual abuse cases that occurred decades ago has taken on wider implications about the accountability of church leaders.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Pell, 74, has become the focal point for victims' frustration over what they say has been an inadequate response from church leaders. Pell himself is not accused of sexual abuse and has twice apologized for the Church's slow response.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>"I have the full backing of the pope," Pell told reporters as he arrived at Rome's Hotel Quirinale to give evidence in front of former abuse victims who traveled to Italy for the late night sessions.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>In his position as Vatican treasurer, Pell met with Pope Francis for a routine meeting earlier on Monday, after telling the inquiry he was "not here to defend the indefensible." </p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>He said was aware of rumors and complaints against pedophile clergy when he was a young priest in the 1970s, but that Church superiors tended to give priests the benefit of the doubt, something he acknowledged was wrong.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Pell said children were often not believed, abusive priests were shuffled from parish to parish and the Church was over-reliant on the use of counseling of priests to prevent further abuses. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>The strong language was welcomed by former victims, but Pell's failing memory on specifics angered witnesses in Rome and Sydney. He repeatedly said he could not recall specific incidents when he was asked about them.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Special prosecutor Gail Furness quizzed Pell via video link from Sydney on Monday. There were audible gasps as the Cardinal said he was deceived by Church leaders who did not inform him about claims against Father Gerald Ridsdale among others.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Ridsdale, who was repeatedly moved from parish to parish, was later convicted of 138 offences against 53 victims.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Ridsdale's nephew, David Ridsdale, was among 15 abuse victims and supporters who traveled to Rome on the back of a crowd-funding campaign to see Pell give evidence after he said he was unable to travel to his native Australia because of heart problems.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>SPOTLIGHT WIN</p><span id="midArticle_14"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Last year, Pell denied accusations made at Commission hearings that he had tried to bribe a victim to remain quiet, that he ignored another complaint and that he was complicit in the transfer of a pedophile priest. </p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>Church sexual abuse broke into the open in 2002, when it was discovered that U.S. bishops in the Boston area moved abusers from parish to parish instead of defrocking them. Similar scandals have since been discovered around the world and tens of millions of dollars have been paid in compensation.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>The hearing started on the same night that Spotlight, a film about newspaper reporters who uncovered systemic paedophilia in the Church in Boston, won the Academy Award for best picture. </p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The Vatican newspaper dedicated two articles to the win, saying Spotlight was not an anti-Catholic film as some have claimed. </p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>"The ogres were not exclusively men in cassocks. Paedophilia does not necessarily derive from a vow of chastity," the newspaper said. "But it is by now clear that there were too many people in the Church who were more worried about the image of the institution than the gravity of the act."</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><span id="midArticle_4"/><p> (Editing by David Gregorio)</p><span id="midArticle_5"/></div>
