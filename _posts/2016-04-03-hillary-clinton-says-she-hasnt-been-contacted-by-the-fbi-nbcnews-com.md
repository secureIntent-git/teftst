                    <p> Former Sec. Hillary Clinton said Sunday she had not yet been contacted by the FBI in the inquiry surrounding the use of a private email server during her tenure as secretary of state in an interview with NBC's Chuck Todd on "Meet the Press." </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Reports indicated that Clinton and her top aides could soon be interviewed by the FBI, but she quickly shot that down. She also pointed out that back in August she "made clear" she was "happy" to answer any questions.  </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> The Democratic front-runner reiterated that her decision to use a personal email as a government official was "a mistake" but challenged anyone else in public office to release his or her emails. </p>
                
              
                    
              
              
                    <p> "I'm the one who's done it, and I did it because I thought it was the right thing to do," she said. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> On Sunday, Clinton said she's "confident" she'll debate Bernie Sanders before the New York primary on April 19, but would not commit to a specific date.  </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> The Clinton and Sanders campaigns have been feuding over potential times in recent weeks, showcasing the latest scuffle in an increasingly heated primary fight. Clinton said she was "confident that there will be" another Democratic debate but made clear that she was "not the one negotiating" the terms.  </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> When pressed if she would agree to a specific date that the Sanders campaign has put forward, Clinton said she'd leave that to her campaign and then turned the question on her rival </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> "We've proposed Thursday the 14th which gives people more time to digest what happens in the debate. Is he in?" she asked. </p>
                
              
                    
              
              
                    <p> The Clinton campaign said in a statement Saturday that Sanders officials had rejected three possible debate dates. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> "The Sanders campaign needs to stop with the games," Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon wrote. "The Sanders campaign needs to stop using the New York primary as a playground for political games and negative attacks against Hillary Clinton. The voters of New York deserve better." </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Sanders' campaign shot back, saying the dates and venues proposed "don't make a whole lot of sense." Spokesman Michael Briggs pointed out that their team had offered their own dates, which he said were rejected by the Clinton campaign.  </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> This all comes after Sanders challenged Clinton to a New York debate on "Meet the Press" last month. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> "I would hope very much that as we go into New York state, Secretary Clinton's home state, that we will have a debate — New York City or upstate, wherever — on the important issues facing New York and, in fact, the country," the Vermont senator said.  </p>
                
              
                    
              
              
                    <p> Sanders and Clinton have also been trading barbs over fossil fuel industry donations after a Greenpeace activist confronted her on the rope line earlier this week. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Clinton, visibly angry, told the young woman she was "so sick of the Sanders campaign lying about me."  </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> When asked Sunday if there were other instances in which she thought Sanders has lied about her record, Clinton deflected. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> "Well, I'm not, you know, I'm not going to go into that. I think that we've tried to run a campaign on the issues. I'm going to keep talking about the issues," she said. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> With several key states coming up, Clinton said she hasn't "moved on" to the general election yet and is still focused on the primary battle ahead of her. </p>
                
              
                    
              
              
                    <p> "I know that I still have work to do to win the nomination, and I'm going to keep reaching out to every voter, everywhere in these remaining contests," she vowed. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> When asked if she was turning her sights to Donald Trump, Clinton said it was important "to draw some pretty clear lines" with Republicans and slammed the Republican front-runner for "his rhetoric, his demagoguery." </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> "When you incite violence, you are acting like a political arsonist" she said, referring to recent aggression against protesters at Trump rallies. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> "We may have differences, of course we do. But we don't condone violence. We don't say we'll pay the legal fees of people who punch other Americans, who are protesting, attending an event. That is just not appropriate behavior when you're running for president." </p>
