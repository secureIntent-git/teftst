<p>Oh SpaceX, you sweet son of a gun. You’ve landed another rocket on a floating ocean barge. </p>
<p>This is the third landing in a row for Elon Musk’s commercial spaceflight company, and the second from a rocket that delivered its cargo to a very high orbit—which means it was coming down increadibly hot. Literally. At six times the speed of sound, atmospheric particles rubbing against the Falcon 9 are trying to burn the thing up. </p>
<p>SpaceX’s <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/04/spacexs-rocket-victorious-robot-boat-last/" target="_blank">first barge landing came in April</a>, on a mission sending a supply-laden Dragon capsule to the ISS. Almost exactly a month later, the company proved the landing wasn’t a fluke. In fact, they upped the ante, <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/05/spacex-landed-freaking-rocket-robot-boat-dark/" target="_blank">landing their rocket in the dark</a>, after sending it 22,300 miles above Earth. This third came down from roughly the same height, and comes a mere 20 days after the last, a testament to the company’s commitment to an <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/04/spacex-just-stuck-historic-landing-now/" target="_blank">increased launch tempo</a>. </p>
<p>Expect to see more landing attempts, and hopefully more landings. Each of the latter slashes tens of millions of dollars from the cost of spaceflight (because rockets=expensive). And later this summer, SpaceX is going to put those savings in action and relaunch one of the recovered rockets. Musk has said each Falcon 9 could theoretically be used 10 or 20 times. That’s pretty sweet. </p>
