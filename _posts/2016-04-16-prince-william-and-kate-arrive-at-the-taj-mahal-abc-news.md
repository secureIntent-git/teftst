The duke and duchess' pilgrimage to the Taj Mahal evoked memories of William's late mother, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/princess-diana.htm" id="ramplink_Princess Diana_" target="_blank">Princess Diana</a>, who visited the same spot in 1992. In what has become one of the most iconic photographs of her life, Diana sat alone at the monument of love, as the Taj Mahal is known, while the Prince of Wales attended an event elsewhere <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/india.htm" id="ramplink_in India_" target="_blank">in India</a>.

</p><p itemprop="articleBody">
The <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/world/prince-william.htm" id="ramplink_Duke of Cambridge_" target="_blank">Duke of Cambridge</a> is "of course aware of the huge esteem his mother, the late Princess of Wales, is held in India, and he appreciates the iconic status of the images that exist of The Princess at the Taj," the statement read.
