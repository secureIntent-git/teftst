                    <p> The path for a potential Supreme Court justice to go from early presidential pick to sitting on the highest court in the country has often been a rocky road. </p>

                    <p> The GOP has already warned President Barack Obama that they will put up a fight if he chooses to nominate someone during his final year in office. </p>
                
              
              
              
                
              
              
              
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                    
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
              
                    
              
              
                    <p> The president on Tuesday, however, didn't back down, saying: "I intend to nominate, in due time, a very well-qualified candidate." </p>

                    <p> Obama might be mindful to avoid someone who seems controversial from the get-go — although that doesn't mean a questionable candidate hasn't won the Senate's approval in the past. </p>

                    <h2> Justice Clarence Thomas </h2>
                
              
                    
              
              
                    <p> His nomination was nearly derailed in 1991 by the testimony of Anita Hill. The then-35-year-old law professor at the University of Oklahoma claimed that Thomas had sexually harassed her when they previously worked at the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission. </p>

                    <p> Hill testified that a married Thomas bragged about his sexual prowess while running the EEOC, openly talked about pornography and one time asked, "Who has put pubic hair on my Coke?" </p>

                    <p> Thomas, who was nominated by President George H.W. Bush to succeed Thurgood Marshall, squeaked by when the Senate voted 52 to 48 to confirm him. </p>

                    <p> Miers' nomination in 2005 turned into a political debacle for President George W. Bush, who was criticized by both Democrats and the right wing of the GOP for picking her as a replacement for retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Miers, a corporate attorney from Texas, had been counsel to Bush's White House administration, but never served as a judge. That rankled some senators who also said she failed to demonstrate an in-depth knowledge of constitutional law. </p>

                    <p> In 1987, President Ronald Reagan nominated <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/video/nightly-news/50252837#50252837">Robert Bork</a> — a former solicitor general and federal judge seen as a champion of conservative ideals — to replace Lewis Powell, who was retiring. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> But from the beginning, Bork was criticized by various groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, for being critical of pro-civil rights decisions, as well as the rights of women after saying Roe v. Wade was unconstitutional. </p>

                  </figure><p> Sen. Ted Kennedy, upon learning of Bork's nomination, went to the Senate floor in fiery opposition, saying: "Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, school children could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censured at the whim of government." </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> That was only the beginning. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Making matters worse were his ties to disgraced President Richard Nixon, whom Bork was an influential adviser to. It was Bork — the U.S. solicitor general and the president's No. 3 — who had to fire special counsel Archibald Cox amid the Watergate scandal. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Ultimately, Bork's nomination process became one of the longest in history after it took 108 days and 12 public hearings before a decision was made. Ultimately, he was rejected by a 58 to 42 vote. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Bork became the last nominee to be rejected outright to the Supreme Court. His name even inspired the verb "to bork" — meaning to vilify a person in order to prevent them from being appointed to public office. </p>

                    <p> After Bork's nomination was abandoned, Appeals Court Judge Ginsburg became another pick by Reagan to fill Powell's vacany. But his bid for the high court failed for an entirely different reason: He admitted to having used marijuana several times. </p>
