<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="6"><p><span class="articleLocation">SAN JUAN</span> Puerto Rico’s Government Development Bank, which announced plans to skip the bulk of a $422 million debt payment on Sunday, said it reached a framework deal with some creditors to keep negotiating a debt restructuring.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The GDB and some of its major creditors, who call themselves the Ad Hoc Group and hold roughly $935 million of GDB debt, will continue talking for the next 30 days. The creditors in a statement on Monday said they would not pursue legal action during that time.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>In a statement late Sunday night, GDB said it reached "indicative terms" of a deal with the creditor group holding about a quarter of the nearly $4 billion in bonds, under which the group would agree to a two-step debt exchange, ultimately recouping about 47 percent of what they are owed.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The deal is a long way from done, and would need participation from all of GDB’s creditors in order to work, the bank said in the statement.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>In a televised speech on Sunday evening, Puerto Rico Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla imposed a moratorium on the debt payment, a "painful" decision he blamed on the absence of U.S. Congressional action to solve Puerto Rico's debt crisis.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The GDB is paying only the interest portion of its debt. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The GDB default is the most significant yet in Puerto Rico, because the bank acts as the main depositary and liquidity source for public agencies like the island’s highway and infrastructure authorities.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>The U.S. territory faces $70 billion in debt, a staggering 45-percent poverty rate and a shrinking population as it enters the most dire stretch of its fiscal crisis. It owes another $1.9 billion on July 1 that Garcia Padilla has said it cannot pay. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Congress is debating a bill that would put the island’s finances under federal oversight and allow it to restructure debt in a bankruptcy-like process, but the bill has faced criticism from conservative and liberal wings of both parties.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>As a U.S. territory, Puerto Rico does not have access to municipal bankruptcy protection.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>In Sunday's statement, GDB President Melba Acosta stressed the importance of a bankruptcy process for Puerto Rico, saying the GDB deal "would be highly unlikely" to work without one.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>The Ad Hoc Group includes hedge funds Avenue Capital Management, Brigade Capital Management, Claren Road Asset Management, Fir Tree Partners, Fore Research &amp; Management and Solus Alternative Asset Management.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Other top investors are Thompson Investment Management and Frost Investment Advisors.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><span id="midArticle_14"/><p> (Additional reporting by Daniel Bases in New York; Editing by Nick Zieminski)</p><span id="midArticle_15"/></div>
