Relieved to have made it, they snapped selfies. Others logged on to messaging applications and Google Maps to plan their onward journey to northern Europe. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"People started asking for my phone to call family and to use the internet," Angelopoulos said. Often, they were stranded at the port sharing one plug.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>"We just wanted to make a positive contribution to local communities through renewable energy," said co-founder Samuel Kellerhals, 21.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>The first two units of Project Elpis -- which means "hope" in Greek -- were designed and built with the help of Greek solar technology company Entec. The pair said they had to overcome red tape along the way.  </p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>"Initially it was quite difficult. Everything in Greece is quite bureaucratic," Angelopoulos said. </p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Now, another three units are in the works with money raised through crowdfunding, a method of generating funds from a large number of people via the internet. Its founders hope to reach as many of the dozens of camps around Greece as possible. </p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>At the Kara Tepe camp on Lesbos where the first unit was installed, authorities and residents are thrilled.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
