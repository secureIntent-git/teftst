      --> <p>ROME—At least one migrant boat capsized off the coast of Libya on the dangerous sea route to Italy on Thursday, leaving some 15 to 20 people dead and possibly more.</p> <p> <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/france-says-more-eu-talks-on-libya-crisis-1458304885" class="icon none">The EU’s naval force</a>, EUNAVFOR, said that observers on one of its planes spotted 15 to 20 bodies about 40 miles off the Libyan coast after a boat with migrants sank. </p> <p>Some 96 migrants were rescued, including a 5-year child transported by helicopter to the Sicilian island of Lampedusa due to his condition, according to the Italian coast guard.</p> <p>There were conflicting reports about the extent of the tragedy. Sea Watch, a private rescue mission, said 16 boats had set off from Libya and that two of them had capsized. The Italian coast guard said it was only aware of one ship that had sunk. </p> <p>Ruby Hartbrich, a spokeswoman for Sea Watch, a private rescue mission with one ship and two speedboats on the site, said that at least 100 people were feared dead. The Italian coast guard and EUNAVFOR wouldn’t comment further on the possible death toll. </p> <p>Ms. Hartbrich had earlier said hundreds were feared dead, but explained that as the rescue team approached a second capsized boat more survivors were found. Each boat was estimated to have at least 150 migrants on board, she said.</p> <!--

      --> <p>The deaths come on top of five on Wednesday when a migrant boat carrying more than 560 people capsized off the coast of Libya. The survivors were rescued and brought to Italy. </p> <p>There were 22 different rescue operations coordinated by the Italian coast guard Thursday in which more than 4,000 migrants have been rescued off the Libyan coast, a spokesman said. He said this figure was a “peak.”</p> <p>After a lull over the winter, the spring has seen a surge in migrants departing from Libya and attempting to reach Italy. More than 40,000 seaborne migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year, roughly on par with the arrivals during the same period last year.</p> <p>The Libya-Italy route saw more than 150,000 arrivals last year, but the phenomenon was overshadowed by the huge surge of migrants arriving in Greece from Turkey. </p> <p>A deal between the EU and Turkey has helped slow that flow to a trickle in recent weeks, while the numbers of migrants attempting to reach Italy has surged again, putting fresh pressure on the government’s efforts to accommodate the new arrivals. </p> <p>In all, 3,771 people died or went missing trying to reach Europe in 2015, while a record one million people reached the continent’s shores, mainly via Greece and Italy, the U.N. refugee agency said.</p> <p> <strong>Write to </strong>Liam Moloney at <a href="mailto:liam.moloney@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">liam.moloney@wsj.com</a> and Valentina Pop at <a href="mailto:valentina.pop@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">valentina.pop@wsj.com</a> </p>
