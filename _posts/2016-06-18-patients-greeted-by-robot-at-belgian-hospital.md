<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">OSTEND, Belgium</span> A Belgian hospital has just welcomed its newest staff member: Pepper, a humanoid robot that speaks 19 languages.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Developed to improve social and health care by the Belgian company Zora Bots, Pepper joined the medical team as a receptionist at Ostend hospital AZ Damiaan.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Pepper will introduce visitors to the hospital, provide information and guide visitors and patients to the correct floor and room. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>With a speed of just 3 km/h (1.8 mph), Pepper is also able to guide slower patients. Fully charged, it can work for up to 20 hours on its own. </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>"The robot itself is a meter 20 high, so it is not like Arnold Schwarzenegger with a leather jacket and an 'I will be back' robot," said Zora Bots' co-chief executive, Fabrice Goffin. "It is a quite nice robot and the reactions are positive for the moment."</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>During the first week, Pepper was mainly used on the hospital’s maternity department.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Bieke Vandeputte, the mother of a newborn baby, was amazed.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>"it is another way of making contact and maybe it is reassuring that it is a robot for some people," she said. “The baby was really sure. He did not mind putting his hands on it. It did not frighten him so I think it will be important. Especially for children."</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Pepper is not the first robot used at the AZ Damiaan hospital, but it is the first to communicate with patients and to have the ability to guide them. </p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Before the arrival of Pepper, the staff had already worked with a predecessor, Zora, for about a year. Zora is smaller and slower than Pepper and used mainly in physical therapy classes.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>At a price of 30,000 euros, Pepper is expensive. So far, only Japanese customers have bought one to use at home.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><p> (Editing by Larry King)</p><span id="midArticle_14"/></div>
