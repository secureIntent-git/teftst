Bush, wrote in an opinion piece in the Washington Post.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>"I'll be voting for Hillary Clinton, with the hope that she can bring Americans together to do the things necessary to strengthen our economy, our environment and our place in the world," he said.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Paulson accused Trump, who has touted his business acumen as a real estate developer during his campaign, of taking "imprudent risk" and then disavowing his debts when ventures fail.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
