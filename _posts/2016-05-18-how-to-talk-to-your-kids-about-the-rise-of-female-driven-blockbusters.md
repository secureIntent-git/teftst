<br><div id=""><p>As you’ve no doubt heard, a <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/05/new-ghostbusters-trailer-calling/" target="_blank">second trailer arrived today</a> for the upcoming reboot of <em>Ghostbusters, </em>a movie more controversial than <em>The Last Temptation of Christ</em>, <em>Kids</em>, <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>, and <em>Lolita 2: Mo’ Lita </em>combined. Why? Simple: It’s about women … <em>who fight ghosts</em>. You read that right: They don’t run from the ghosts, or become the ghosts’ sassy BFFs, or point and yell, “Ooooh no, a g-guh-guh-guh-<em>ghoooooooost</em>!” They fight the ghosts, sans men, in a movie that puts women protagonists front and center and drops them directly into the action.</p>
<p>This isn’t an isolated incident: Last summer, Charlize Theron—a woman, mind you—played a ferocious desert warrior in <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em>, all but stealing the movie from its titular hero. A few months later, <em>Star Wars: </em><em>The Force Awakens </em>shocked audiences by focusing largely on Rey, a young woman (there’s that word again!) who could fly the <em>Millennium Falcon</em> and spar with a lightsaber. This winter’s <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/04/rogue-one-star-wars-story-teaser/" target="_blank"><em>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</em></a> also appears to focus on a female lead, as does next week’s <em>Alice Through the Looking Glass. </em>It’s no longer an epidemic, it’s an epifemic!</p>
<p>Many worried observers have taken their concerns to the Internet, where they’ve engaged in <a href="http://fusion.net/story/276398/ghostbusters-trailer-backlash-sexist-comments/" target="_blank">calm</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&amp;q=ghostbusters%20rape%20childhood" target="_blank">wholly rational</a> back-and-forths on social media about the new <em>Ghostbusters </em>and the troubling semi-surge in female-driven blockbusters. Perhaps your kids have heard these debates and have questions (and concerns) of their own—questions like, “Why are all of these in-control female characters on my screen all of a sudden?” and “Will they ever go away?” and “What do <em>I </em>do if I’m confronted by a nuanced, honest, fully rendered female character?”</p>
<p>Our advice? Hold your young ones close, and calm their nerves with these three talking points:</p>
<p><strong>1) Let them know they’re not alone.</strong></p>
<p>Kids feel safer when they’re part of a crowd, so make sure they understand that many adults share their concerns about the ever-so-slightly escalating number of big-screen female characters. Just two years ago, Mike Fleming Jr—an actual grown-up at an actual grown-up publication—wrote “<a href="http://deadline.com/2014/08/film-chauvinist-asks-do-we-want-an-estrogen-powered-ghostbusters-813645/">Film Chauvinist Asks: Do We Want An Estrogen-Powered ‘Ghostbusters?’</a>” to ask what gave Sony “the right to take <em>Ghostbusters</em> from knuckle-dragging Neanderthals like me who have little else going for us but our all-time top 10 or 20 favorite guy movies, and [to allow for] the prospect of a revamp that feels like the original guy version of one of the films on that list? What’s next, a<a href="http://www.deadline.com/tag/goodfellas" target="_blank"><em> Goodfellas</em></a> redo with female mobsters pulling off the Lufthansa heist? A <a href="http://www.deadline.com/tag/raging-bull"><em>Raging Bull</em></a> redo with<a href="http://www.deadline.com/tag/rhonda-rousey"> Rhonda Rousey</a>?” (Hilarious! But a valid concern, given that Rousey is starring in a <em><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=rousey+road+house&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">Road House </a></em>remake.)</p>
<p>Meanwhile, of the 32 million-plus viewers who watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3ugHP-yZXw">the first <em>Ghostbusters </em>trailer on YouTube</a>, more than 800,000 of them downvoted it, making it among the most hated-upon trailers in the site’s history. One film critic so hates the idea of the new Ghostbusters that he’s vowed <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/lol/ghostbusters-reboot-movie-critic-refuses-to-review/">not to watch it</a>—not because he’s sexist, but because he’s logical: Why would any film writer at a sci-fi-loving, geek-culture-championing, deeply nostalgic site <em>possibly </em>want to watch a movie about ghosts and demons and laser guns that’s being spun off from one of the most popular ’80s franchises ever? (Whatever the reason, rest assured, it has <em>nothing </em>to do with sexism).</p>
<p>See? Your progeny may be afraid, but they’re not alone. When it comes to fearing women-centric films, there’s safety in numbers.</p>
<p><strong>2) Remind them that men <em>still</em> do most of the heavy lifting around Hollywood.<br/></strong></p>
<p>Sure, the last few years have seen the female-driven (or, at least, female-focused) blockbusters like <em>Fifty Shades of Grey</em>, <em>Maleficent</em>, <em>Cinderella</em>, and even franchise titles like <em>The Hunger Games</em>, <em>Pitch Perfect</em>, and the <em>Divergent </em>series. Don’t let it get to you, though; when it comes to big franchises, men still rule. Despite the success of the <em>Avengers </em>films—and the <em>Captain America </em>films, and the <em>Iron Man </em>films, and the <em>Thor </em>films—we still don’t have a Black Widow movie in the works (a real threat, given that actress Scarlett Johansson is a bigger box-office success than nearly all of her Marvel-movie castmates). And you’ll notice that despite helping save the world, Wonder Woman didn’t even get a titular shout-out in <em>Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice</em>. In fact, countless ongoing franchises have never included a woman in the lead role, from <em>Transformers </em>to <em>Night at the Museum </em>to <em>Alvin and the Chipmunks</em>. Your kids should feel safe knowing they could watch three hit movies a day for an entire month and never once see a lead female character. Phew!</p>
<p><strong>3) If all else fails, whisper in their little ears: <em>It’s only a movie, it’s only a movie…</em></strong></p>
<p>Granted, it can be horrifying when a funny (if shaggy) movie made three decades ago is handed over to a bunch of women, even if those women are reliably funny comic performers who have headlined Oscar-nominated movies, and who came up at some of the most respected comedy institutions in the world. But <em>actual</em> women being handed the reins of a major IRL enterprise? That’s just a fantasy, and your children can take comfort knowing that, in the real world, women still <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/women-in-elite-jobs-face-stubborn-pay-gap-1463502938">earn less than male counterparts</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/11/upshot/women-on-boards-where-the-us-ranks.html?_r=0">remain underrepresented on the boards of major US corporations</a>, and <a href="http://time.com/4326519/aclu-government-sexism-female-directors-hollywood/">barely get their own movies made</a>. So while the new <em>Ghostbusters</em>—and its estrogen-energized brethren (sistren?)—may disturb, it’s not like your children risk seeing these women walking off the screen and, I dunno, leading a Fortune 500 company, having a major studio production greenlit, or earning as much as their male co-stars. Ha-ha! Come on, what’s next? Dogs and cats living together?</p>
