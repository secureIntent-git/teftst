"Detective Servin was prosecuted for a crime based on false facts."</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Servin, the first Chicago police officer in more than 15 years to be charged in a fatal shooting, was found not guilty of involuntary manslaughter in April 2015 in the death of Rekia Boyd. A Cook County judge said Servin's actions were intentional and thus did not fit the charges brought by the state's attorney.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Prosecutors said at the time that Servin was in his car when he shot Boyd with an unregistered semiautomatic handgun after an argument with a group of young people in an alley. She died the next day. Servin's attorneys had argued the officer believed his life was in danger from another man in the crowd.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
