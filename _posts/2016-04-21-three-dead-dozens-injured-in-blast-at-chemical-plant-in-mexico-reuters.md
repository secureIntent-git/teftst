<span class="focusParagraph" readability="7"><p><span class="articleLocation">MEXICO CITY</span> A massive explosion rocked a major petrochemical facility of Mexican national oil company Pemex in the Gulf state of Veracruz on Wednesday, killing at least three people, injuring dozens more, and pumping a cloud of noxious chemicals into the sky.</p></span><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>Luis Felipe Puente, head of federal emergency services, told Reuters that three people had died in the blast. The governor of Veracruz state, Javier Duarte, later said 105 were hospitalized, including 58 Pemex workers, according to his official Twitter account.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Pemex said the explosion, which sent a huge, dark plume of smoke billowing upwards, occurred just after 3 p.m. (2000 GMT) at the facility's chlorinate 3 plant near the port of Coatzacoalcos, one of the company's top oil export hubs.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Local emergency officials said hundreds of people had been evacuated from the site. Television footage showed an initial burst of flames followed by a tower of thick smoke. A company official said local oil exports were unaffected.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>What caused the blast was unclear, but Pemex warned local residents to keep away from the site due to what it described as a dissipating cloud of toxic fumes. TV footage showed rainclouds gathering above the plant as evening fell.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Pemex Chief Executive Jose Antonio Gonzalez was traveling to Coatzacoalcos late on Wednesday to oversee the response.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Petroquimica Mexicana de Vinilo, or PMV, a vinyl petrochemical plant that is a joint venture between Pemex's petrochemical unit and Mexican plastic pipe maker Mexichem (<span id="symbol_MEXCHEM.MX_0">MEXCHEM.MX</span>) was the facility hit by the blast.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Operated by Mexichem, the plant lies within Pemex's larger Pajaritos petrochemical complex. Mexichem said in a statement the explosion occurred in an ethylene unit at the plant. The company could not be immediately reached for further comment.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>In February, a fire killed a worker at the PMV plant, which makes vinyl chloride monomer, also known as chloroethene, an industrial chemical used to produce plastic piping.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The incident occurred just weeks after three workers were killed and seven injured when a fire broke out on a Pemex oil-processing platform in the Gulf of Mexico.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>It also came as Pemex implements deep cost cuts to cope with the rout in oil prices, and seeks to stem a slide in output. Mexico is in the midst of a historic push to lure private investors to revive its oil industry.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Pemex, which enjoyed a decades-long monopoly over Mexico's oil and gas industry until an energy reform opened up the sector in 2014, has experienced a series of high-profile accidents.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>In 2013, at least 37 people were killed by a blast at its Mexico City headquarters, and 26 people died in a fire at a Pemex natural gas facility in northern Mexico in September 2012.    </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>A 2015 fire at its Abkatun Permanente platform in the oil-rich Bay of Campeche affected oil output and cost the company up to $780 million.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Pemex said last year it had reduced its annual accident rate in 2014 by more than 33 percent. But a Reuters investigation found that Pemex was reducing its accident rate by including hours worked by office staff in its calculations.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><span id="midArticle_15"/><p> (Reporting by David Alire Garcia, Gabriel Stargardter, Liz Diaz, Dave Graham and Anna Yukhananov; Editing by Simon Gardner, Peter Cooney and Andrew Hay)</p><span id="midArticle_16"/></div>
