  <p>“Get this clown out of my town!” they shouted, carrying signs that read, among other things, “Trump = Hitler” and “Combat white supremacy.”</p><p><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics">Election 2016</a> | <a href="http://www.latimes.com/trailguide">Live coverage on Trail Guide</a> | <a href="http://graphics.latimes.com/2016-election-march-15-results/">March 15 election results</a> | <a href="http://graphics.latimes.com/2016-election-delegates/">Track the delegate race</a> | <a href="http://www.latimes.com/health/la-newsletter-essential-politics-signup-page-htmlstory.html">Sign up for the newsletter</a>  </strong></p><span class="trb_ar_cont" data-ar-cont="Article continues below"/>
    <p>Three people were arrested for blocking the roadway.

He’s weak on immigration. He’s in favor of amnesty.”</p><p>As for the Ohio governor, Trump said: “Kasich is a nice guy, but honestly very weak on illegal immigration.

Don’t worry about the tunnel stuff.”</p><p>Protesters hollered from a grass slope outside the rally, “Trump is hate!” But uniformed deputies from Arpaio’s office kept them so far away that they could barely be heard.</p><p>At the makeshift roadblock, protesters denounced the candidate as his supporters looked on.</p><p>“Trump is very misogynistic, racist, sexist and a fascist,” said Jeanne Mayeux, a 52-year-old Fountain Hills resident who carried a sign that said, “Stand against racism.”</p><p>Mayeux is a member of MoveOn, one of several liberal groups that organized the protest. “I believe he would be a real danger if he gets into office,” she said.</p><p>Bill and Evelyn Hoffman, Republican retirees from Rio Verde, Ariz., were in the first car directly facing the protesters.</p><aside class="trb_embed" data-content-id="84761246" data-content-size="small" data-content-type="story" data-content-slug="la-newsletter-embed-promo-essential-politics" data-content-subtype="storylink" data-role="socialshare_item  imgsize_ratiosizecontainer " data-state=""/><p>“This is a bunch of nuts, but that’s all right; they have their rights,” said Bill Hoffman, 80, sporting a black cap with Trump’s “Make America great again” slogan. “I don’t like his methods, but what he stands for, I believe in.”</p><p>Evelyn Hoffman, 76, added, “He got the whole country interested in politics, and he’s indebted to nobody.”</p><p>At both rallies, Arpaio and Brewer praised Trump’s call for the border wall. And in Tucson, Arpaio boasted of the arrests in Fountain Hills.</p><p>“We locked up some demonstrators,” he said to a burst of cheers, “and threw them in jail.”</p><p><strong>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/finneganLAT">@finneganLAT</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/LATSeema">@LATSeema</a></strong></p><p><strong>ALSO</strong></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-trump-tea-party-divide-20160318-story.html">Donald Trump's campaign might break apart the tea party</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/la-na-breitbart-rise-fall-20160318-story.html">Andrew Breitbart warned conservatives about Trump, but he never saw this coming</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-hillary-clinton-aids-response-20160319-story.html">Hillary Clinton made a mistake at Nancy Reagan's funeral.
