<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="6"><p><span class="articleLocatio&lt;/span&gt;n">Real estate developer Bart Blatstein said on Friday he will reopen the Showboat, one of Atlantic City's four shuttered casino hotels, in July, but without the gambling.</span></p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Blatstein, chief executive of Philadelphia-based Tower Investments, said in a statement that 852 hotel rooms will open in two towers at the Showboat, making it the largest non-casino hotel in New Jersey.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The announcement comes after state lawmakers and Governor Chris Christie ended months of bickering over the best way to help cash-strapped Atlantic City, passing legislation that gives the city much-needed aid and 150 days to craft a recovery plan before facing a possible state takeover.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"Last week our lawmakers ... gave investors a strong blueprint for fiscal stability.Â I now see a clear path and bright future for this city I love so much," Blatstein said.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The Showboat was one of four Atlantic City casinos to close in 2014 largely because of competition from neighboring states with newly legalized gambling. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>All four remain closed, and up to half of the eight casinos that remain could potentially shutter if New Jersey moves forward with plans to open two new casinos outside of the city in the northern part of the state, closer to New York City.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The expanded gambling proposal, however, faces a long and uncertain future and voters, who are evenly split on the issue, must still first decide in November whether to approve it. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>The Showboat carries a deed restriction that currently prevents it from reopening the casino. Former Showboat owner Caesars Entertainment Corp closed it in 2014 even though it had been marginally profitable.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Asked whether he would ever seek to reopen the casino at Showboat, Blatstein said in a phone interview that "all options are open ... It's a remarkable property. I'm very bullish on Atlantic City."</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>He aims to open the hotel by July 4, though it could take an additional week.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>"To open up that many rooms in a month's time, it's a lot of sheets and pillowcases. It's a lot of work," he said.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Blatstein has other developments in the seaside resort town, including the boardwalk entertainment and retail complex The Playground at Caesars casino hotel.    </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>In May, the city council also gave the city the green light to negotiate with Blatstein on the sale and development of public land between the Showboat and neighboring Revel Casino Hotel, which is also closed, the Press of Atlantic City reported.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><span id="midArticle_14"/><p> (Reporting by Hilary Russ; Editing by Tom Brown)</p><span id="midArticle_15"/></div>
