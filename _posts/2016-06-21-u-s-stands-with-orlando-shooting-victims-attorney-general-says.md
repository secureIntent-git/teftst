The gunman, Omar Mateen, who used an assault rifle and pistol, was killed by police after a three-hour standoff.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Lynch said it was a "cruel irony" that the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community - one defined almost entirely by who they love - was so often a target of hate.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"Let me say to our LGBT friends and family ... this Department of Justice, and your country, stands with you in the light," Lynch told a news conference.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>"We stand with you to say that the good in the world far outweighs the evil; that our common humanity transcends our differences; and that our most effective response to terror and hatred is compassion, unity and love."</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Lynch declined to give new details on the investigation, a day after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said Mateen had described himself as an "Islamic soldier" during the rampage.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Mateen, a U.S. citizen of Afghan descent pledged allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State militant group in a 911 call from the nightclub, but authorities said he appears to have been "self-radicalized" and to have acted alone.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Citing unnamed law enforcement officials, CNN said on Tuesday that Mateen, 29, visited Pulse earlier on the night of his attack. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>CNN also reported that the day before the rampage he bought plane tickets for himself, his wife and his child to travel in July from West Palm Beach, Florida, to San Francisco.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>In a transcript of his calls released by the FBI on Monday, Mateen told police negotiators to tell the U.S. government to stop bombing Syria and Iraq, and he threatened to strap bomb vests on hostages, though no explosives were found at the scene.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><span id="midArticle_12"/><p> (Reporting by Barbara Liston; Writing by Daniel Wallis; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Bill Trott)</p><span id="midArticle_13"/></div>
