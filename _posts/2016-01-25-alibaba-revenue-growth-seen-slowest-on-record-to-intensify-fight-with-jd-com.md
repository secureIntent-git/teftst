<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="6"><p><span class="articleLocation">SHANGHAI/BEIJING</span> Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd is expected to post its weakest quarterly revenue growth on record, Thomson Reuters data shows, a slowdown analysts say will heat up the battle with smaller rival JD.com Inc in a tougher economy.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Alibaba's revenue for the quarter ending December is projected to grow at 26.6 percent, according to a Thomson Reuters SmartEstimate survey of 28 analysts, which would be the slowest rate since the company started publishing such data 3-1/2 years ago.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The pace also lags the 47-51 percent revenue growth JD.com projected for the same period, which is also the slowest expansion since the company started releasing records.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Alibaba and JD.com declined to comment, citing the pre-earnings quiet period.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>"When the market starts to slow you start to have real winners and real losers," said Brian Buchwald, chief executive of consumer intelligence company Bomoda. "I think that they need to pay attention to their immediate competition."</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>JD.com has focused on more affluent shoppers in China's biggest cities, a strategy that may be paying off in an economy that last year grew at its weakest pace in a quarter of a century..</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>While the two companies calculate the total value of goods sold - known as gross merchandise volume (GMV) - differently, JD.com's GMV grew 82 percent in the nine-months to September while Alibaba's rose 34 percent, suggesting China's biggest e-tailer was losing market share.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Earlier this month, Alibaba Chief Executive Daniel Zhang said the company will pivot towards these "first-tier" cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, after having trumpeted a push into China's countryside, as well as abroad.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>In an article on Alibaba's blog page, Zhang also said the company was seeking to retain and win over more customers by "enhancing reputation and optimizing user experience".</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>This may be a tough ask, as quality concerns still dog Alibaba and as JD.com has already carved out its own space in these cities by offering speedy delivery and quality assurances.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>"They have faster shipping speeds, and the quality is more trustworthy," said Zoe Li, who works at a tech start-up in Beijing, referring to JD.com compared to Alibaba.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Last month, the Chinese e-commerce giant avoided being named on a U.S. blacklist for sites hosting the sale of fake goods, and appointed a new head of anti-counterfeiting.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><p> (Reporting by John Ruwitch in SHANGHAI and Paul Carsten in BEIJING; Editing by <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=miral.fahmy&amp;">Miral Fahmy</a>)</p><span id="midArticle_14"/></div>
