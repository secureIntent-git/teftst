<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="6"><p><span class="articleLocation">BURNS, Ore.</span> Four die-hard anti-government militants held their ground at an Oregon wildlife refuge on Friday, a day after the FBI released a video of the fatal shooting of one of the protesters at a traffic stop.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>As the standoff with federal authorities neared the end of its fourth week, Greg Bretzing, special agent in charge of the FBI's Portland office, said on Thursday night authorities were trying to negotiate with the four holdouts.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>They are holed up at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, 30 miles (48 km) from Burns, a small ranging town in the state's arid southeast. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The movement's jailed leader, Ammon Bundy, has issued two separate messages through his attorney urging the few remaining protesters at to stand down, saying the group would continue their fight against federal land policy in court.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The occupation began on Jan. 2  when Bundy and at least a dozen followers occupied a small cluster of buildings at the refuge in a flare-up in the so-called Sagebrush Rebellion, a decades-old conflict over federal control of millions of acres in the West. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>The FBI took the unusual step on Thursday of releasing video footage of the shooting of 54-year-old Robert LaVoy Finicum, a rancher from Arizona who had acted as a spokesman for the occupiers.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The video was released hours after a lawyer for Finicum's family said other evidence may exist that shows the Arizona rancher was not threatening authorities.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>On Tuesday, some of the group's most recognizable members, including Bundy, were stopped by the FBI and Oregon State Police as they headed to a speaking event. Bundy and four others were taken into custody and Finicum was killed.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>VIDEO OF SHOOTING</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Authorities said Finicum was armed when he was killed. Aerial video taken from a law enforcement aircraft shows Finicum speeding away from authorities in a white truck and nearly striking a law officer, while trying to evade a police barricade before barreling into a snowbank and exiting the car.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The grainy footage shows Finicum raise his hands in the air and then turn and flail his arms, which lower down to his body before he is shot by Oregon State Police troopers, according to the FBI. </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Bretzing, who narrated the video for reporters, said Finicum can be seen reaching for his jacket pocket, where law enforcement found a handgun. But the lack of focus in the video makes it difficult to discern Finicum's precise movements before the shooting.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>"Based on some things that I've seen, I think there is potentially a completely different side to the story compared to what is being represented," Finicum family attorney Todd Macfarlane told Reuters. He could not be reached for reaction to the FBI video release.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Macfarlane said one of the sources for his view was the version of events from Victoria Sharp, who says she was at the scene and watched Finicum die.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Sharp said in an interview with Reuters that Finicum was shot with his gun in his holster and his hands in the air, shouting and walking toward police.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>Neither state nor federal law enforcement would comment on whether Sharp was at the scene or on her own detailed description. Reuters was not able to independently confirm her version of the events. </p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The FBI's Bretzing told reporters that the law enforcement's video was released "in the interest of transparency."</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Following his initial court appearance in Portland on Wednesday, Ammon Bundy urged the holdouts to stand down, saying he would continue the fight in court.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Reactions to the takeover by Burns residents have ranged from sympathy for two imprisoned local ranchers whose plight began the protest, to dismay at the armed occupation by individuals seen as outsiders.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><span id="midArticle_5"/><p> (Additional reporting by Gina Cherelus in New York, <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=daniel.wallis&amp;">Daniel Wallis</a> in Denver, Victoria Cavaliere and <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=dan.whitcomb&amp;">Dan Whitcomb</a> in Los Angeles, Curtis Skinner in San Francisco, and <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=juliaedwards&amp;">Julia Edwards</a> in Washington; Editing by Frank McGurty and <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=frances.kerry&amp;">Frances Kerry</a>)</p><span id="midArticle_6"/></div>
