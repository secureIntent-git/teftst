(Neil Hall/Reuters)</span> </div>  <article itemprop="articleBody" readability="66.438576349024"><p> <span class="dateline"> LONDON — </span>Right-wing firebrand and populist politician, Nigel Farage, resigned as leader of his U.K. Independence Party on Monday morning, saying he had “done his bit” as one of the chief campaigners for the country to leave the European Union.</p> <p>The resignation is the latest political bombshell to hit British politics in the wake of last month’s popular vote to withdrawal from the 27-member bloc. Also on Monday, parliamentarian Andrea Leadsom announced her intention to run for the leadership of the ruling Conservative Party — and by extension, prime minister — which has been thrown into disarray in the wake of the E.U. referendum.</p> <p>Prime Minister David Cameron, current leader of the Conservative Party, announced his resignation the morning after the vote on June 23. The decision by British voters to leave the E.U. plunged the U.K. in to political and economic turmoil. A new leader will be chosen by Sept. 9.</p> <p> “I have never wanted to be a career politician. That is why I now feel that I've done my bit,” Farage said in a televised press conference on Monday.</p> <p>Farage and the UKIP have taken a hard line against immigration and the E.U.’s emphasis on freedom of movement, calling for stricter measures at the border.</p> <p>“I will watch the renegotiation process in Brussels like a hawk,” he said of talks expected to be held between U.K. and E.U. leaders in the coming months. But, Farage said, “I want my life back.”</p> <p>Despite having won the campaign to extricate the U.K. from E.U. institutions, the leaders of the movement — popularly known as Brexit — all appear to be fading into the background of British politics.</p> <p>Prior to Farage's resignation, former London mayor and pro-Brexit campaigner, Boris Johnson, announced last week that he would not be running for leader of the Conservative Party. He was the favorite to take the keys to No. 10 Downing Street.</p> <p>His announcement came on the same morning that his fellow campaigner and supposed ally, Michael Gove, declared his own candidacy. The move shocked Britain, prompting comparisons to Shakespearean-style treachery or an episode of the political drama, House of Cards.</p> <p>In the meantime, Gove’s popularity has plummeted. Conservative MP Theresa May, has also emerged as a candidate for leader. She had campaigned for the U.K. to remain in the E.U., and has portrayed herself as a unifying figure in the party.</p> <p>The first round of voting for the Conservative leadership begins later on Monday, and will eliminate the fifth of five candidates for the job.</p> <p channel="wp.com" class="interstitial-link"> <b>Read more</b> </p>    <p channel="wp.com" class="interstitial-link"> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world">Today’s coverage from Post correspondents around the world</a> </p> </article> </div>
