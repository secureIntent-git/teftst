Search revenues represented some 84 percent of the firm's total sales in 2015.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Baidu shares have fallen since the controversy over the death of student Wei Zexi erupted at the start of the month and had lost 10.5 percent of their value by last week's close.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The restrictions mean the company must clean up in-search healthcare adverts and paid-for search adverts of any kind cannot only be based on the highest bidder, a statement from the internet, industry and health regulators which was posted on the website of the Cyberspace Administration of China said.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Such adverts must be restricted to no more than 30 percent of a page of search results, the statement said.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>"If they do enforce that, it would likely significantly cut into revenues," said Mark Natkin, managing director of Beijing-based Marbridge Consulting.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>A spokeswoman for Baidu said it accepted the regulator's decision and will firmly implement the requirements on it following the in-search adverts investigation.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Baidu has come in for fierce online criticism for how it handles adverts within its search results.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Before his death, 21-year-old student Wei Zexi not only criticized the military-run hospital that provided the failed treatment for misleading claims about its effectiveness but also  alleged that Baidu, which controls 80 percent of the Chinese search market, had promoted false medical information.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Baidu said when the inquiry started it was also conducting an investigation and would fully cooperate with the regulator.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>The company said it applied particular vigilance to healthcare customers, with screening for misleading adverts and a verification program with additional scrutiny for medical advertisers and had cleaned up its customer base.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><span id="midArticle_12"/><p> (Editing by Alexander Smith)</p><span id="midArticle_13"/></div>
