It's Miss Teen USA. But still, it's a promising start.</p><p>The Miss Universe Organization announced Wednesday that it was <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/776566/miss-teen-usa-to-eliminate-the-swimsuit-competition" target="_blank">doing away with the swimsuit competition</a>, a staple of beauty pageants for almost 100 years, at the next Miss Teen USA pageant.</p><p>Which makes sense, considering the stated purpose of the contest is to award scholarship money and, as MTUSA <a href="https://twitter.com/MissTeenUSA/status/748175144745635840" target="_blank">just noted on Twitter</a>, "[celebrate] young women who lead active, purposeful lives."</p><p>Besides, with an age group ranging from 14- to 19-year-olds... Wait, they've been having a <em>swimsuit</em> competition?!</p></section></div><div id="text-2" data-social-animate="true" data-hook="scrollable-block" data-align="left" readability="59.5">

And doesn't society already have a daily swimsuit competition called the beach? That one can be grueling enough.</p><p>And yet year after year, contestants for Miss USA, Miss Universe, Miss America and countless other pageants at every level (city, county, state, country, etc.) have featured dozens of women wearing what amounts to hydrophilic underwear parading around.</p><p>It's widely accepted because it's just the way that it's always been <em>done</em>, the first Miss America pageant in 1921 being advertised as a "bathers revue," but Miss America <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/missamerica/peopleevents/e_inclusion.html" target="_blank">also used to require</a> "that contestants must be of good health and of the white race."

Since Miss America, et al. vehemently insist that they're all about education, female empowerment and sisterhood...why not just treat the ladies to a beach field trip or a tropical vacation and get back to the business of talent, current events and sportsmanship on stage?</p></section></div><div id="photo-txt-6" data-social-animate="true" data-hook="scrollable-block" data-align="left" readability="41">

It happens, no one's the worse for wear if you're into pageants and other contests where physical appearance comes into play.</p><p>If you stop to really think about it, though...What <em>is</em> this, when 51 women (or in Miss Teen USA's case, girls) strut around in mostly bikinis and the world gets all excited if one of them happens to look slightly more curvaceous than all the rest?! Though at least we've come that far.</p><p>Then again, there are plenty, inside the pageant world and probably plenty outside too, who never saw anything wrong with the swimsuit competition, which Miss Teen USA is replacing with an athletic-wear competition.</p></section></div><div id="photo-txt-7" data-social-animate="true" data-hook="scrollable-block" data-align="left" readability="47.723586521987">

"It's to show the physical fitness of the contestants."</p><p>And the party line has held for decades, though Miss World dropped the swimsuit portion in 2014, largely out of respect for contestants from countries where such things are frowned upon. ("It's not just a beauty contest, it's 'beauty with a purpose'. There didn't seem to be a purpose to have the swimsuit," Chris Wilmer, the national director of Miss World America/Miss United States organization, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/miss-world-pageant-puts-bikini-ban-future-competitions/story?id=27691720" target="_blank">told ABC News at the time</a>.)</p><p>"The swimsuit competition hasn't ever been about being sexy," former Miss USA <strong><a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/shanna_moakler">Shanna Moakler </a></strong><a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/776775/shanna-moakler-defends-miss-usa-s-swimsuit-competition-but-thinks-athletic-wear-could-be-a-fun-change" target="_blank">told E! News today</a>. "It's about showcasing your dedication to your health and fitness and how you exude confidence. These girls work hard."</p><p>And their commitment to health and fitness will presumably still be on full display in the athletic wear. As for the more grownup installments of the franchise, the swimsuits stay for now.</p><p>"For Miss Universe and Miss USA, that's a very important part of the competition and will continue to be an important part of the competition," Michael Antinoro, head of original content at IMG, which bought the Miss Universe Organization from <strong><a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/donald_trump">Donald Trump</a></strong> last year, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/30/style/miss-teen-usa-pageant-dumps-the-swimsuit.html?_r=0" target="_blank">told <em>The New York Times</em></a>.</p><p>The presumptive Republican presidential nominee was a fan of the swimsuit competition while he was involved with the organization, <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/428239/donald-trump-defends-bikini-contests-on-miss-world-competition" target="_blank">telling <em>Fox &amp; Friends </em>in 2013</a> in response to what was then just a report that Miss World might end the practice, "Well, I own Miss Universe, so I'm actually very happy about it—because if [Miss World] doesn't have bikinis their ratings go right down the tubes."</p></section></div>
