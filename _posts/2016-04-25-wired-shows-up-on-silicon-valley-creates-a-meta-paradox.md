<p>After Prince’s tragic death last week, much of the public mourning on social media involved reminiscing about the artists’s many incredible live performances. Some of these, like the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame tribute to George Harrison and the Super Bowl XLI halftime show, were already available. But in the wake of the news, even the <em>SNL</em> afterparty performance Jimmy Fallon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0XleMIKKNg" target="_blank">talked about</a> on <em>The Tonight Show</em> a year ago <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMNKnC9K8Uo" target="_blank">made it to YouTube</a>, complete with backing vocals by Maya Rudolph (whose cover band Princess <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmWHBdwyv-I" target="_blank">performed a tribute</a> over the weekend) and Este Haim.</p>
<p>And now, Prince’s final live performance has been posted in full on SoundCloud. As part of his Piano and a Microphone tour, the April 14 concert at Atlanta’s Fox Theatre can’t match the ebullience of a full-band Prince concert experience—but it still had a career-spanning <a href="http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/prince/2016/fox-theater-atlanta-ga-4bf1fbf6.html" target="_blank">setlist:</a> “Little Red Corvette”; “Nothing Compares 2 U”; and a third encore finale medley of “Purple Rain,” “The Beautiful Ones,” and “Diamonds and Pearls.” It’s a 90-minute show with several long interludes, so anyone still unable to handle the news can get just a little bit closer to one final concert.</p>
