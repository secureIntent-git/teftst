<br><div id=""><p>We live in a world where <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BEJegO1AvoQ/?taken-by=justinbieber">Justin Bieber coloring in an anime character</a> is actually reported as news, so it should be no surprise that reporting the biggest events on the Internet is often a mixed bag. But where there is often “WTF?” there is also hope. The pushback against the movie version of <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>, for example, has been both fascinating and heartening to see; <a href="https://twitter.com/jontsuei/status/720803388355530753">Jon Tsuei’s Twitter thread</a> offers arguably the best summation of the subject, and should be considered a must-read for those wanting to catch up. As for everything else, well, it’s been a strange past seven days for all involved, it seems—and, to some, a sexy one. Unless you live in North Carolina, where… Actually, we’ll get there soon enough. Here are just some of the things you might have missed in the last week on this here World Wide Web.</p>
<h3>Please Silence Your Phones, Except For the Text Alerts Because Oh God No</h3>
<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> AMC thought allowing texting during movies might be OK. Then it didn’t.<br/><strong>Where It Blew Up:</strong> Twitter, media think pieces<br/><strong>What <em>Really</em> Happened:</strong> You have to give Adam Aron, the head of AMC Entertainment, credit for thinking outside of the box, even when his new idea is a stinker. Aron, you see, <a href="http://variety.com/2016/film/news/amc-texting-theaters-phones-1201752978/">revealed in an interview this week</a> that he is considering a pilot program to allow moviegoers to text during screenings.</p>
<p>The news <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2016/04/14/why-allowing-texting-in-movie-theaters-is-still-a-horrible-terrible-no-good-very-bad-idea/#221192fd64af">swiftly</a> <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/04/why-movie-theaters-should-ban-cellphones/478287/">got</a> <a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/texting-may-soon-be-allowed-inside-americas-biggest-mov-1770857630">shared</a> <a href="http://time.com/4293830/amc-theaters-texting-movies/">across</a> <a href="http://gothamist.com/2016/04/14/wow_amc_really_gets_us.php">the</a> <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/04/largest-movie-chain-ponders-allowing-texting-in-theaters/">Internet</a>, <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/04/14/474226195/clash-of-the-screens-should-movie-theaters-allow-texting-amc-says-maybe">with</a> <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/04/14/amc-may-allow-texting-during-movies-millennials/83033082/">much</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/15/movies/texting-in-movie-theaters-the-internet-does-not-approve.html?_r=0">panic</a>, and that panic was shared on Twitter:</p>

<p><br/><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> Behold the power of Internet outrage: Less than two days after Aron’s statements circulated online, AMC <a href="http://variety.com/2016/film/news/amc-texting-theaters-not-allowed-1201754502/" target="_blank">released a statement</a> saying it wouldn’t allow texting, saying “that idea has been sent to the cutting room floor.” </p>
<h3>The Award for Least Sexy Political Protest Goes to…</h3>
<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> To protest the state’s anti-LGBTQ laws, porn site xHamster shut off access to North Carolina this week.<br/><strong>Where It Blew Up:</strong> Twitter, blogs, media think pieces<br/><strong>What <em>Really</em> Happened:</strong> The passing of House Bill 2 in North Carolina—the so-called  “bathroom bill” that <a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article68401147.html">undoes</a> anti-discriminatory laws protecting transgender rights in the state—has led to a backlash that <a href="http://www.advocate.com/politics/2016/4/13/heres-all-business-nc-has-lost-because-anti-lgbt-bill">involves many businesses pulling out of NC</a>, including the announcement this week that <a href="http://perezhilton.com/2016-04-11-xhamster-shuts-down-porn-access-north-carolina-anti-lgbt-law-controversy-statement/?from=post#.VxDr9iMrK2w">porn aggregator xHamster has blocked access</a> to those in North Carolina.</p>
<p>A statement from the site joked, “Judging by the stats of what you North Carolinians watch, we feel this punishment is a severe one,” and added that the company “will not standby and pump revenue into a system that promotes this type of garbage. We respect all sexualities and embrace them.” (Not to mention monetize them, but that might undercut the message a little.)</p>

(It did, however, <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/04/13/bring_back_our_xhamster_nc_net_smut_watchers_grumble/">appear to be working as a protest</a>.)</p>
<p>On Twitter, reaction to the move was mostly amused:</p>

<h3>Finally, the Literary Blockbusters About the Election We’ve Been Hoping For</h3>
<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> How best to broaden the appeal of Democratic presidential nominee Bernie Sanders? Wait. This may be something…<br/><strong>Where It Blew Up:</strong> Twitter, blogs<br/><strong>What <em>Really</em> Happened:</strong> It’s possible that you’ve never heard of Chuck Tingle, the pseudonymous author of gay porn with titles like <em>Space Raptor Butt Invasion</em> and <em>Unicorn Butt Cops: Beach Patrol</em>. In that case, you won’t know that <a href="http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/277144/chuck-tingle-announces-presidential-campaign-with-channing-tatum-as-running-mate/">he’s decided he’s running for president</a>. But just because he’s running, doesn’t mean he can’t be inspired by his fellow candidates. </p>

<p>Yes, that’s a hint for exactly what you think it is.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" readability="5.9673913043478"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Enjoy new tingler FEELING THE BERN IN MY BUTT. important political message for all buds <a href="https://t.co/RnHXWCwXFs">https://t.co/RnHXWCwXFs</a> <a href="https://t.co/PphhgYa4oO">pic.twitter.com/PphhgYa4oO</a></p>
<p>— Chuck Tingle (@ChuckTingle) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChuckTingle/status/718826105411534848">April 9, 2016</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Tingle has discovered Bernie Sanders, much to the <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/slog/2016/04/12/23944791/rule-36-applies-to-2016-election">excitement</a> <a href="https://www.egotastic.com/2016/04/gay-political-unicorn-fiction-thanks-internet">of</a> <a href="http://www.avclub.com/article/chuck-tingles-bernie-sanders-unicorn-erotic-fictio-235119">the</a> <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/lol/chuck-tingle-feel-the-bern/">Internet</a>. And who can blame people for being excited, with this kind of deathless prose?</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" readability="6.9428571428571"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My friend is live-tweet the Chuck Tingle Feel the Bern book but it's protected account. Here's an excerpt. <a href="https://t.co/ZePmcXDvAa">pic.twitter.com/ZePmcXDvAa</a></p>

<p>While this is definitely a new type of outreach, there’s no denying that it could be a successful one and just the type of push that Bernie’s campaign needs to take New York and other other remaining states. Hey, if xHamster can force change in North Carolina, who’s to say that self-published porn isn’t the way forward nationally?<br/><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> OK, maybe we were getting carried away, even if tongue-in-cheekily. Let’s see what others think.</p>

<h3>Um, Who Said These Were Imperfections?</h3>
<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> An ad for a dating site tried to be cute, and crashed and burned as a result.<br/><strong>Where It Blew Up:</strong> Twitter, media think pieces<br/><strong>What <em>Really</em> Happened:</strong> Consider it a spectacular failure of foresight in the field of marketing: Match.com’s latest UK ad campaign was intended to get customers to “love their imperfections,” with the tagline “If you don’t like your imperfections, someone else will.” The problem? The images that went with the tagline to illustrate said imperfections. </p>

<h3>A (Maybe True) Tale of McDonald’s and Milkshakes</h3>
<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> A late night trip to a McDonald’s turned into a classic Twitter story.

<p>This has, in turn, prompted a discussion about whether or not honesty on Twitter in stories such as these are important, whether the story being untrue makes it a “hoax” or an attempt to hoodwink the audience, and if Raby is somehow a bad guy for telling a story. The obvious response to all of these questions is this: Go and re-read the story. Is it really less amusing because parts of it are exaggerated?<br/><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> Actually, if there’s one real takeaway, it’s this: McDonald’s has a surprisingly great sense of humor about the whole thing:</p>
