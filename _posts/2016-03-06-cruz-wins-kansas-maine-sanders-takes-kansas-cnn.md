<br><p>Ted Cruz has won the Kansas and Maine Republican caucuses as the Texas senator seeks to use the Super Saturday contests to bolster his argument that he is the only viable alternative to Donald Trump.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders picked up his first win of the night in the Kansas Democratic caucuses.</p><p>Cruz's robust performance comes on a day of primaries and caucuses in five states. The win in Maine, along with his victory in Alaska on Super Tuesday, suggests that Cruz can expand his political base beyond his home state of Texas and states that are heavily influenced by evangelical and social conservatives.</p><div readability="142.94319108453"><p class="zn-body__paragraph">The GOP slate Saturday, with 155 delegates up for grabs, also includes a caucus in Kentucky and a primary in Louisiana, in which Trump is expected to do well. But it's likely to be yet another tough night for Sen. Marco Rubio, who has claimed only one win so far in the race and is now facing a must win contest in Florida on March 15.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">With 100% of the Kansas votes counted, Cruz was at 48.2%, with Trump at 23.3%, Rubio at 16.7% and Ohio Gov. John Kasich at 10.7%. </p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Cruz won the Maine caucuses with 45.84% of the vote, short of the 50% threshold that would have given him all of the state's 23 delegates. Trump was second at 32.55%, Kasich was at 12.17%, while Rubio was fourth at 8 %, the state party said.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Cruz also got a morale boost from the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) outside Washington, where he won a straw poll, further demonstrating his appeal to the Republican Party's conservative base.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">"God bless Kansas. And God bless Maine," Cruz said, and argued that his performance on Saturday represented an important pivot point in the GOP race.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">"What we are seeing is Kansas is a manifestation of a real shift in momentum," Cruz told reporters in Idaho where he had a campaign event. He again asked rival candidates to "prayerfully" consider whether they had a path to victory as he sought to unite opposition to Trump.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">But results pouring in from Kentucky suggest that Trump is doing better than in Kansas and Maine. With 21% of votes counted, Trump leads at 41.9%, ahead of Cruz at 30.3% and Rubio on 13.2%.</p><div class="el__embedded el__embedded--fullwidth"><div class="el__image--fullwidth js__image--fullwidth"><div><img class="media__image media__image--responsive" alt="" data-src-mini="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160305155844-super-saturday-delegates-small-169.jpeg" data-src-xsmall="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160305155844-super-saturday-delegates-medium-plus-169.jpeg" data-src-small="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cruz-wins-Kansas-Maine-Sanders-takes-Kansas-CNN.jpe" data-src-medium="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160305155844-super-saturday-delegates-exlarge-169.jpeg" data-src-large="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160305155844-super-saturday-delegates-super-169.jpeg" data-src-full16x9="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160305155844-super-saturday-delegates-full-169.jpeg" data-src-mini1x1="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160305155844-super-saturday-delegates-small-11.jpeg" data-demand-load="not-loaded" data-eq-pts="mini: 0,  xsmall: 221,  small: 308,  medium: 461,  large:  781" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7"/><noscript><img alt="" class="media__image" src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cruz-wins-Kansas-Maine-Sanders-takes-Kansas-CNN.jpe"/></noscript></div></div></div><p class="zn-body__paragraph">While Kansas may represent too small a sample to validate Cruz's claims, it is clear that his win will be parsed for signs that it represents the stirrings of a backlash against Trump, after the billionaire became embroiled in a controversy he was slow to repudiate the Ku Klux Klan, and introduced a vulgar note into a Republican debate on Thursday night.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">On the other hand, the victory by Cruz in Kansas appears to fit squarely into historical precedent. Like Cruz, the previous two victors of that state's GOP contests, Rick Santorum in 2012 and Mike Huckabee in 2008, had strong appeal among evangelicals which they had also demonstrated by winning the Iowa caucuses.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Neither went on to win the nomination.</p><div class="el__embedded el__embedded--fullwidth"><div class="el__image--fullwidth js__image--fullwidth"><div><img class="media__image media__image--responsive" alt="" data-src-mini="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160305154834-delegates-super-saturday-small-169.jpeg" data-src-xsmall="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160305154834-delegates-super-saturday-medium-plus-169.jpeg" data-src-small="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1457230204_504_Cruz-wins-Kansas-Maine-Sanders-takes-Kansas-CNN.jpe" data-src-medium="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160305154834-delegates-super-saturday-exlarge-169.jpeg" data-src-large="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160305154834-delegates-super-saturday-super-169.jpeg" data-src-full16x9="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160305154834-delegates-super-saturday-full-169.jpeg" data-src-mini1x1="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160305154834-delegates-super-saturday-small-11.jpeg" data-demand-load="not-loaded" data-eq-pts="mini: 0,  xsmall: 221,  small: 308,  medium: 461,  large:  781" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAJAJEAAAAAAP///////wAAACH5BAEAAAIALAAAAAAQAAkAAAIKlI+py+0Po5yUFQA7"/><noscript><img alt="" class="media__image" src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1457230204_504_Cruz-wins-Kansas-Maine-Sanders-takes-Kansas-CNN.jpe"/></noscript></div></div></div><p class="zn-body__paragraph">And while he is talking up his national prospects, the Texas senator has so far not shown much capacity to win expand his appeal beyond hard-core conservatives.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Super Saturday voting is happening in the wake of former Republican nominee Mitt Romney's assault on Trump, which ignited a civil war within the GOP between establishment figures and the billionaire's army of angry 'outsider' voters.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Democrats, meanwhile, are going to the polls in Kansas, Louisiana and Nebraska with 109 pledged delegates at stake.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Hillary Clinton is looking to further cement her lead over her challenger Sanders, though the Vermont senator had an advantage in the fact that the contests in Kansas and Nebraska are caucuses, a format in which he has tended to perform better than primaries during the 2016 campaign.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">The Super Saturday contests offer a chance for the two front-runners to quicken their momentum after they both came out of the contests last Tuesday with solid delegate leads. They still face major battles in crucial elections in Michigan, Ohio and Florida over the coming weeks.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Louisiana political analyst Silas Lee told CNN on Saturday that his state could reflect the underlying trends shaping the wider Republican race.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">"It looks like Louisiana will follow the trends with the previous results from Super Tuesday, whereby Clinton will win by a significant margin," Lee said. "With the Republicans, it looks like Trump."</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Clinton has a lead of about 200 pledged delegates over Sanders, while Trump leads Cruz by around 100 delegates and is about 200 delegates ahead of the third place candidate Rubio.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">Rubio put on a brave face, saying that the states being contested on Super Saturday favored other candidates, but predicted that his fortunes would soon change. He predicted victory in his home state of Florida on March 15.</p><p class="zn-body__paragraph">"The map only gets friendlier for us after tonight," Rubio told reporters during a trip to Puerto Rico, which holds a Republican primary on Sunday. "There will be more delegates awarded in Florida than basically every state that voted tonight combined."</p></div>
