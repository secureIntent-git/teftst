In the last few days, it has drawn attention in the White House and prompted accusations that the state had ignored a health risk in a largely black city. Flint’s plight also emerged as an issue in Sunday’s Democratic presidential debate.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="296" data-total-count="1834" itemprop="articleBody">The crisis has spawned multiple investigations, and has set local and state officials scrambling to find a remedy for the problem. Flint residents have been put at risk because of the high levels of lead leaching from water pipes, caused by a switch to less expensive water from the Flint River.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="496" data-total-count="2330" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Snyder cited repeated missteps by members of his administration, including misunderstanding regulations and failing to immediately identify the presence of lead in Flint’s drinking water. He also said that he was told the lead problem was limited to one household, and that worries about lead were raised as long ago as last February. He pointedly thanked the whistle-blowers who detected the lead levels in the water and in children’s blood, prompting a flurry of action in recent weeks.</p><div id="Moses" class="ad moses-ad nocontent robots-nocontent">

                After Flint, Mich. switched its water from Detroit’s water system to the Flint River in April 2014, high levels of lead were found in children in Flint. The city is now in a state of emergency; National Guard troops arrived this week.            </p>

</figure><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="259" data-total-count="3604" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-7">Much of the criticism has been aimed at Mr. Snyder. A former accountant who had not sought public office until he was elected in 2010, he had cultivated a reputation as an able administrator who would bring a businessman’s eye to state and local government.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="506" data-total-count="4110" itemprop="articleBody">But two forays into local government blew up in recent weeks as serious questions were raised about decisions made by emergency managers appointed by him in Flint and in Detroit, where the public schools are deteriorating physically and are close to insolvency. Mr. Snyder addressed both in his speech, as well as concerns about the state’s aging infrastructure. In both cases, his administration’s competence and compassion were questioned, and critics noted that both cities were predominately black.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="373" data-total-count="4483" itemprop="articleBody">The Detroit Free Press <a href="http://www.freep.com/story/opinion/editorials/2016/01/16/flint-water-snyder/78798458/">demanded full accountability</a>, starting with the governor’s emails, which under state law were protected from public scrutiny. On Monday, protesters marched outside Mr. Snyder’s apartment building in Ann Arbor, demanding his arrest. As he prepared to deliver his address, demonstrators waited outside the Capitol, waving signs calling for justice.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="343" data-total-count="4826" itemprop="articleBody">“What took the governor so long to do something about this?” asked Dan Reyes, 46, an autoworker and Flint resident who brought bottles full of the city’s tap water to offer to legislators. “The message is clear to us: Flint is a predominantly minority, poor community. In Flint, you don’t matter to Snyder’s brand of politician.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="206" data-total-count="5032" itemprop="articleBody">Over and over on Tuesday, Mr. Snyder expressed contrition, referring to the matter as a “crisis” and “catastrophe,” saying “mistakes” had been made and promising to pray for the people of Flint.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="535" data-total-count="5567" itemprop="articleBody">But he also left residents of the city, whose population has dwindled with the departure of the auto industry to fewer than 100,000, with unanswered questions. Why did state officials switch the source of its water from Lake Huron to the Flint River, known to locals as a dumping ground for trash and pollutants? Why did it take months before complaints about the water’s odor and rusty color were taken seriously? Who knew about the lead problem, and when? Would it have happened at all in a city populated by affluent white people?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="285" data-total-count="5852" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-8">In Michigan, whose state Legislature is controlled by Republicans, members of Mr. Snyder’s party have sprung to his defense. Ronna Romney McDaniel, the chairwoman of Michigan’s Republican Party, said she was confident in Mr. Snyder’s ability to help fix Flint’s water problems.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="191" data-total-count="6043" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-9">“He’s turned our state around,” Ms. McDaniel said. “I think he is the perfect governor to help lead us through this crisis. I know he will be solution-oriented and action-oriented.”</p><figure id="media-100000004154407" class="media photo embedded has-adjacency layout-large-horizontal media-100000004154407 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="http://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/20/us/20michigan-web/20michigan-web-articleLarge.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group"><span class="visually-hidden">Photo</span>

Running under the slogan “One Tough Nerd,” he was elected in the Republican wave that swept Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Gov. Paul LePage of Maine into office. He has spent his brief political career promoting “relentless positive action,” in his oft-deployed and characteristically cheerful phrase, over partisan politics.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="292" data-total-count="7767" itemprop="articleBody">In 2013, he angered many Republicans in Michigan by allowing a <a title="Recent and archival health news about Medicaid." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/medicaid/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">Medicaid</a> expansion in his state as part of the Affordable Care Act. Yet he also dismayed Democrats when he signed a bill in 2012 making Michigan a “right to work” state, a measure that diminishes the power of organized labor.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="109" data-total-count="7876" itemprop="articleBody">Michigan’s governors are subject to term limits, so Mr. Snyder will not be running for re-election in 2018.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="248" data-total-count="8124" itemprop="articleBody">Arthur Woodson, a Flint resident who has helped organize and lead protests drawing attention to the city’s water situation for more than a year, said he had not voted for Mr. Snyder but had initially been somewhat optimistic about his leadership.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="212" data-total-count="8336" itemprop="articleBody">“I thought he was going to get in and be more moderate and work with the people,” said Mr. Woodson, who was helping protesters board buses traveling to Lansing on Tuesday. “But it hasn’t been that way.”</p>
