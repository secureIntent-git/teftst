<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="7"><p><span class="articleLocatio&lt;/span&gt;n">A gun battle erupted in west Houston late Sunday morning, leaving two people dead and six wounded, and forcing authorities to issue a shelter-in-place order as residents prepared for Memorial Day festivities, authorities said on Sunday. </span></p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Two suspects were involved in the shooting, and one of them is believed to have shot and killed the other, Houston Interim Police Chief Martha Montalvo told reporters. </p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Later, a post on the department's Facebook page said the suspect was fatally shot by a Houston SWAT officer. There was no immediate explanation for the apparent contradiction, and police could not be immediately reached to clarify.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The second suspect was wounded by officers and transported to a nearby hospital in critical conditions, the post said. </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Montalvo said police did not know the motives behind the shootings and are seeking the public’s help.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>“We are trying to piece all of this together,” she said. “It’s still a very ongoing investigation.”</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The victims of the rampage, which unfolded over hours, included two wounded constables who were treated at a hospital and released. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>The second fatality, described as a "citizen," was found by police in a vehicle. Montalvo said it was unclear what connection, if any, that person had with the suspects. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Adding to the mayhem that gripped the area in the middle of a long holiday weekend, a fire broke out and destroyed a gasoline filling station near the shooting scene. Television video showed the charred station and fire crews still on the scene in mid-afternoon.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Montalvo did not address the connection, if any, between the shootout and a fire-ravaged Conoco gas station nearby. Fire officials could not be reached for comment.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>The suspects also took aim at a helicopter hovering above the scene, and at least one shot hit the chopper. </p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>"Obviously they had a high-powered rifle," Montalvo said. "We believe one of them had an AR-15.” </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>The violence escalated after a patrol officer responded to the first report of gunshots and quickly came under fire. Several bullets hit the patrol car's windshield but the officer was unharmed. </p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Soon more units, including a SWAT team, arrived on the scene, in an area of west Houston just east of the Sam Houston Tollway, a major highway dissecting the Texas city.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><span id="midArticle_15"/><p> (Reporting By Frank McGurty in New York and Kevin Murphy in Kansas City; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Phil Berlowitz)</p><span id="midArticle_16"/></div>
