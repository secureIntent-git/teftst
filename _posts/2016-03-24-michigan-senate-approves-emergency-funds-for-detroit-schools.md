<span class="focusParagraph" readability="3"><p><span class="articleLocatio&lt;/span&gt;n">The Michigan Senate on Thursday approved a $48.7 million emergency spending package aiming to keep the cash-strapped Detroit public schools open in April.</span></p></span><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>The appropriations bill originated in the state House of Representatives, where it passed earlier this month. A spokesman for Governor Rick Snyder said he intended to approve emergency spending to keep schools open.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Detroit's public school system, Michigan's largest, operates 97 schools for about 47,000 students. It is sinking under $3.4 billion of debt and other obligations, and its academic performance is among the worst in the United States.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The emergency spending is immediate and would allow the school district to continue operating in its current year, which ends in mid-June.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>On Tuesday, the state Senate also approved a long-term $715 million package for the school system in Detroit, one of the poorest U.S. cities, but that legislation has not yet been debated in the House.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>If approved by the House, the long-term bailout would take effect in the next school year.    </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>The schools are being run by Transition Manager Steven Rhodes, a former federal bankruptcy judge appointed by Governor Rick Snyder. Rhodes had said that without the emergency funds, he would have to close schools after April 8 because the district is out of money to pay teachers and staff.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
