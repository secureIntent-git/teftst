<span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocatio&lt;/span&gt;n">Facebook Inc's (<span id="symbol_FB.O_0">FB.O</span>) board has proposed removing Mark Zuckerberg's majority voting control in the event of the social media giant's chief executive and founder deciding to exit management at some point in future.</span></p></span><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>In a proxy filing with the U.S. Securities and  Exchange Commission, Facebook's board said it would ask shareholders to vote on a proposal that would convert Zuckerberg's Class B shares into Class A shares if he is no longer in a leadership position. The move was first proposed in late April in a regulatory filing.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>As of June 2, Zuckerberg beneficially owned about 4 million Class A shares and about 419 million Class B shares, collectively representing about 53.8 percent of total outstanding voting power and 14.8 percent of total outstanding economic interests.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The proposed move, to be voted on at Facebook's annual general meeting on June 20, is designed to make sure a future Facebook chief's management powers aren't limited, the board said. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"These new terms thus ensure that we will not remain a founder-controlled company after we cease to be a founder-led company," the board said in the filing on Thursday. </p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Under current provisions, Zuckerberg is allowed to hold Class B shares and exercise majority voting control even if he leaves the company. Zuckerberg would also be allowed to pass his Class B shares, and possibly his majority voting control, to descendants after his death.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
