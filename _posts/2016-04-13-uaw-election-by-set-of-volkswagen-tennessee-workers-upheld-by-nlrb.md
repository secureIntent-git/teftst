<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocatio&lt;/span&gt;n">The U.S. National Labor Relations Board voted 2-1 to uphold a December election by a small group of workers at Volkswagen AG's (<span id="symbol_VOWG_p.DE_0">VOWG_p.DE</span>) Tennessee plant to join the United Auto Workers, the NLRB announced on Wednesday.</span></p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>VW had asked for a review of the election involving about 160 of the plant's workers, who are skilled trades employees, in which 71 percent voted to join the UAW. The plant has a total hourly workforce of about 1,400 workers.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The UAW will now see if it has additional leverage to press VW to agree to come to the negotiating table for the 160 skilled trades workers, members of UAW Local 42 in Chattanooga, to bargain on wages and benefits.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Officially, the NLRB voted to keep in place a regional director's ruling that affirmed the December election by the skilled trades workers.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>VW at the Chattanooga, Tennessee plant had no immediate reaction to the NLRB order.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>A dissenter on the NLRB said that the skilled trades workers do not work separately from the rest of the VW plant workers. The two NLRB members in the majority said the company had failed to prove an "overwhelming community of interest" between the skilled trades employees and the rest of the plant's hourly workers.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
