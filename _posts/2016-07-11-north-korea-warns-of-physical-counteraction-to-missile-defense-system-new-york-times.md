<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="367" data-total-count="1519" id="story-continues-1">It did not elaborate on how its decision would affect the fate of Kim Dong-chul, a Korean-born American citizen who <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/30/world/asia/north-korea-kim-dong-chul-sentence.html">was sentenced</a> to 10 years of hard labor in April after being convicted of spying and other offenses. Another American, Otto F. Warmbier, is serving 15 years of hard labor for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/17/world/asia/north-korea-otto-warmbier-sentenced.html">trying to steal a political banner</a> from his hotel in Pyongyang, the capital.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="303" data-total-count="1822">On Wednesday, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/07/world/asia/obama-puts-sanctions-on-north-korean-leaders-for-human-rights-abuse.html">the United States placed sanctions on Mr. Kim</a> for the first time, accusing him of human rights abuses. It also blacklisted other top officials in North Korea, as well as the intelligence and security ministries there, over abuses including extrajudicial killings, forced labor and torture.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="96" data-total-count="1918">North Korea has called the sanctions “an open declaration of war” and warned of retaliation.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="313" data-total-count="2231">North Korea is already under heavy sanctions for its nuclear and ballistic missile tests. But by singling out Mr. Kim, its 32-year-old leader, Washington sought to use pressure over human rights as leverage. The North is especially sensitive about outside criticism of its leader, who rules by a personality cult.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="223" data-total-count="2454">Earlier Monday, North Korea threatened an unspecified “physical counteraction” once the United States and <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/southkorea/index.html?inline=nyt-geo" title="More news and information about South Korea." class="meta-loc">South Korea</a> decided upon a site in the South where an advanced American missile defense system would be deployed.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="242" data-total-count="2696">The warning from the North Korean military, carried by K.C.N.A., was its first reaction since <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/08/world/asia/south-korea-and-us-agree-to-deploy-missile-defense-system.html">South Korea and the United States announced</a> an agreement on Friday to deploy the Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad, system in the South.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="251" data-total-count="2947">The allies said the deployment was to better protect South Korea and the United States military in the region from the North’s growing nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities. Officials were expected to reveal the site for a Thaad base this year.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="219" data-total-count="3166">On Monday, North Korea said that the rationale to deploy Thaad was “absurd,” adding that all its military weapons, including <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/23/world/asia/north-korea-missile-test.html">an intermediate-range ballistic missile it tested last month</a>, were for “self-defense.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="355" data-total-count="3521">North Korea “will take a physical counteraction to thoroughly control Thaad,” the military said in its statement, which characterized the system’s deployment part of an American plan for “world domination.” In addition, the military vowed to act against the system “from the moment its location and place have been confirmed in South Korea.”</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="179" data-total-count="3700" id="story-continues-2">The statement did not elaborate. But it also said that the North had long placed South Korea and American military bases in the region under the range of its missiles and rockets.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="373" data-total-count="4073">American and South Korean defense officials viewed the test of the North’s Musudan missile last month as the latest proof that the country was developing a capability to strike American military bases in the Pacific, including those on Guam, a major launching pad for American reinforcements should a conflict break out on the Korean Peninsula or elsewhere in the region.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="308" data-total-count="4381">On Monday, North Korea said the Thaad deployment was part of the United States’ plan to build “an Asian version of NATO” to check China and Russia and secure military hegemony in the region. It also said that the deployment would place South Korea deeper under the Americans’ “military dominion.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="201" data-total-count="4582">South Korea and the United States insisted that Thaad was solely to protect their forces from North Korea. But <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/09/world/asia/south-korea-us-thaad-china.html">China</a> and Russia have opposed its deployment, seeing it as a threat to their own security.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="217" data-total-count="4799">Analysts said that the deployment would make China value North Korea’s role in countering United States influence in the region and become less cooperative in enforcing <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/03/world/asia/north-korea-un-sanctions.html">United Nations sanctions</a> against its neighbor.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="346" data-total-count="5145">North Korea test-fired a submarine-launched ballistic missile on Saturday, although the South characterized it as a failure. The country also <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/world/asia/north-korea-hydrogen-bomb-test.html">conducted its fourth nuclear test</a> on Jan. 6 and followed up a month later with the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/world/asia/north-korea-moves-up-rocket-launching-plan.html">launch of a long-range rocket</a>, widely considered as part of its program to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile.</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#whats-next">Continue reading the main story</a>
