<br><div id=""><p>The Billboard 200 chart for the week ending April 7 contained a surprising Number One album: Kanye West’s <em>The Life of Pablo</em>.</p>
<p>What makes that surprising? Well, Kanye released the album—albeit in an incomplete form—two months ago. The rollout, which followed a years-long hype campaign and many title changes, was fraught with technical difficulties and release date switch-ups. At first you could download it on KanyeWest.com and Tidal, but then Kanye decided to stream it only on Tidal. It was a debacle, but Kanye <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kanye-west-there-will-be-no-more-cds-from-me-20160307" target="_blank">remained committed</a> to the streaming-only model, even people <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2016/02/16/kanye-west-the-life-of-pablo-piracy-tidal-exclusive/" target="_blank">widely pirated the album</a>. After all that, it seemed highly unlikely that <em>Pablo</em> would ever see many fans’ hard drives—let alone the Billboard charts.</p>



<p>Then, on April 1, <em>The Life of Pablo</em> began trickling out to other streaming services, and was once again available to download. And for the first time, Nielsen SoundScan received sales info, so the album could be included on the Billboard chart. Nearly two months after its debut, <em>Pablo</em> still generated enough interest to reach No. 1—94,000 equivalent album units, only 28,000 of which were pure album sales. It’s the first time an album has hit the top spot with more than 50 percent of the album sales coming from “streaming equivalent units.”</p>
<p>That tipping point has been approaching since <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6320099/billboard-200-makeover-streams-digital-tracks" target="_blank">Billboard introduced</a> streaming and track equivalent units in December, 2014, something it called “the most substantial methodology update” in more than two decades. The methodology sparked some big numbers for artists—Rihanna’s <em>Anti</em> hit the top spot on April 2 with streaming accounting for 45 percent of its total—but Kanye charting with 70 percent streaming, and without a traditional major-label rollout, is something else entirely. <em>The Life of Pablo</em> creates an opening for other artists who rely largely on digital sales and streams to crack the upper echelon of the Billboard charts.</p>
<h3>Digital Chart-Toppers Are a Long Time Coming</h3>
<p>The success of <em>Pablo</em> is definitely momentous—and a long time coming. “I’m a little surprised it didn’t happen sooner,” says David Bakula, senior vice president of analytics at Nielsen Entertainment. “This is non-traditional in terms of the way [<em>The Life of Pablo</em>] got to Number One, but I think this will become far more regular than anyone had anticipated.”</p>
<p>Now that streaming is a growing segment of the music business—30 to 40 percent, by Bakula’s estimation—more <em>Pablos</em> are coming. He points to Drake and his upcoming <em>Views from the 6</em>, which reportedly will be an Apple Music exclusive for its first week, as another album that could capitalize on the new methods for calculating album sales.</p>
<p>Although the new methodology marked a paradigm shift, Bakula believes it’s not altogether different from what happened with retail chains during the heyday of huge first-week album sales in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It’s just that now streaming services are fighting for exclusive windows of premium content from highly popular artists—which is what other businesses, from physical stores to video streaming services like Netflix, have competed over for decades.</p>
<h3>Can Independent Artists Live <em>The Life of Pablo</em>?</h3>
<p>Artists like Drake, Rihanna, and Kanye are popular enough to chart through millions of track purchases as well as streams being counted as retail units. (Billboard uses a formula that gives one “stream equivalent album” for 1,500 streams.) But ideally, giving some weight to streaming performance instead of merely counting album sales (digital or physical) provides an inroad to the Billboard charts for artists without the marketing or distribution machine of a major label.</p>
<p>Jonathan Pardo, who manages <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/boyceavenue" target="_blank">Boyce Avenue</a>—the independent pop rock trio with one of the <a href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6070120/how-boyce-avenue-outdid-beyonce-won-the-internet" target="_blank">most popular YouTube music channels</a> in the country—expects to see more “accidental charting” of artists who go viral without a heavy marketing push. “I think you’re going to see a lot of artists who wake up on a Friday to find they’re in the Top 20,” he says. “They put out a record, it goes viral, and all of a sudden it’s ‘Harlem Shake.'”</p>
<p>Billboard added YouTube plays to its formula for the Hot 100 singles chart <a href="http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1549766/billboard-charts-add-youtube-views" target="_blank">in 2013</a>, then got around to incorporating track and streaming equivalent units more than a year later. The RIAA started counting non-traditional sales toward gold and platinum album certifications <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/02/riaa-streaming-platinum/" target="_blank">earlier this year</a>, using a similarly complicated formula.</p>
<p>So for a band like Boyce Avenue, it’s not about the single-week sales numbers, it’s about building a core of devoted fans who stay with the band for years. “That’s why we’ve recently started to apply for gold and platinum plaques, a more cumulative achievement, since YouTube views and Spotify streams now count for that sort of stuff,” says Pardo. “In terms of any one week, it’s not really anything that we focus on just because on an independent project, we can’t put all of our resources toward one week.” In that case, this change doesn’t necessarily help out artists who derive most of their business from non-traditional sales—it just gives the big artists more avenues of collecting the requisite numbers needed to stay at the top of the charts.</p>
<p>The industry spent years catching up while independent artists figured out how to survive by embracing forward-thinking models. Pardo is happy to see Billboard and others finally recognize the artists, but says they’re behind the curve.</p>
<p>“Now they’re coming to us now and saying, ‘We’re going to validate you,'” Pardo says. “And we’re going, ‘We’re already validated. We make plenty of money, we have a huge fan base, and we do whatever we want, so thanks.'”</p>
