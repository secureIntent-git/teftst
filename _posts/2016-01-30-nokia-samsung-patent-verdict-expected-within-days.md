<span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">HELSINKI</span> Nokia (<span id="symbol_NOKIA.HE_0">NOKIA.HE</span>) and Samsung (<span id="symbol_005930.KS_1">005930.KS</span>) are expected to settle their two-year patent dispute within days, with analysts forecasting a one-time payment of hundreds of millions of euros for the Finnish company.</p></span><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>Nokia entered into a binding arbitration with South Korea's Samsung in 2013 to settle additional compensations for a five-year period starting from early 2014. </p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The International Chamber of Commerce's arbitration court is due to make its ruling on the issue imminently.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Nordea analyst Sami Sarkamies, one of few analysts to give a precise estimate, said the verdict could boost Nokia's operating profit by about 700 million euros ($758 mln) this year, forecasting the court will stipulate an annual patent fee of 300 million euros. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"Samsung has been paying Nokia probably 100 million per year, and the rate could now come up to around 300 million euros (per year). The settled rate will also be paid retrospectively for the last two years," Sarkamies said.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>"But they have already booked perhaps 100 million a year from Samsung to their income statement, so the EBIT impact for this year could be around 700 million euros." </p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Sarkamies has a "hold" rating on Nokia shares, which have fallen 9 percent since last April when it announced a 15.6 billion euro takeover of French network gear rival Alcatel-Lucent (<span id="symbol_ALUA.PA_2">ALUA.PA</span>), due to be completed this quarter.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Investors have worried about the integration process and special terms negotiated by the French government, but the share price could get a boost if the settlement with Samsung is much bigger than analysts forecasts.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Last month, Sweden's Ericsson (<span id="symbol_ERICb.ST_3">ERICb.ST</span>) said that a patent license deal with Apple Inc (<span id="symbol_AAPL.O_4">AAPL.O</span>) would help lift its intellectual property rights revenue by up to 40 percent in 2015, sending its shares up sharply.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Nokia, which once dominated the global mobile phones market, is now focused on telecom network equipment but still holds on to a portfolio of phone patents. </p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>It said last month that the International Chamber of Commerce had advised that the settlement with Samsung is expected by the end of January. </p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>A Nokia spokesman declined to comment on Saturday, saying the company had nothing to add beyond the previous statement.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p> ($1 = 0.9233 euros)</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><p> (Reporting by <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=jussi.rosendahl&amp;">Jussi Rosendahl</a>; Editing by Susan Fenton)</p><span id="midArticle_14"/></div>
