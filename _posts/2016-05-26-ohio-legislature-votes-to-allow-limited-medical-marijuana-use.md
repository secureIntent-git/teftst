It remains illegal on the federal level. </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The Ohio legislation is more limiting than some in that it only allows patients with specific medical conditions to use an oil, edible, tincture or vapor form of marijuana prescribed by a physician licensed in the state, starting in 2017. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"This bill is not perfect, but itâ€™s what Ohio patients need," Ohio Senator Kenny Yuko, a Democrat, said before his house approved the bill. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>"Marijuana is not a gateway drug, but a gateway off drugs."</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Medical marijuana users would not be allowed to smoke or grow their own marijuana under the measure, which also would  create a commission responsible for regulating and licensing of all operations of the drug.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>In November, Ohio voters soundly rejected a measure that would have made it the first U.S. Midwestern state to legalize the recreational use of marijuana.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Lawmakers from both parties voted for and against the bill on Wednesday. Some opponents of the measure have said that the qualifying list of medical conditions is too limited. </p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>The measure was fast-tracked to head off a possible less-restrictive medical marijuana ballot initiative in November. </p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>In a poll released in early May, 90 percent of Ohio voters supported the legalization for medical marijuana. </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><p> (Reporting by Kim Palmer in Cleveland; Editing by Michael Perry)</p><span id="midArticle_14"/></div>
