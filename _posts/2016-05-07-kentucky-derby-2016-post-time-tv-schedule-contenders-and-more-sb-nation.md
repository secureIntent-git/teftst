<br><p>Tune into NBC at 4 p.m. ET to watch all the Kentucky Derby festivities.</p><div id="article-body" readability="126.03988378236">
    <p><span>The </span><a href="http://www.sbnation.com/kentucky-derby" target="_blank">2016 Kentucky Derby</a><span> will be held at 6:34 p.m. ET Saturday. But Churchill Downs plays host to an entire day's worth of racing before </span><a href="http://www.sbnation.com/2016/5/5/11603180/kentucky-derby-2016-odds-nyquist-seattle-slew" target="_blank">Nyquist can attempt to become yet another in a line of favorite </a>who won on race day.</p>
<p>NBCSN's coverage begins at noon, with the broadcast moving to NBC at 4 p.m. The streaming service begins at noon on NBC Sports Live Extra, as well.</p>


<p>The Kentucky Derby undercard begins as early as 10:30 a.m. The first of the day's stakes races will be held at 1:13 p.m., the Grade II Churchill Distaff Turf Mile. The Grade II Churchill Downs Stakes Race follow at 1:55, and the Grade I Humana Distaff at 2:45 p.m.</p>
<p>The second-biggest race of the day immediately proceeds the Kentucky Derby: The Grade 1 Woodford Reserve Turf Stakes, which carries a $500,000 purse, is scheduled for 5:25 p.m. Big Blue Kitten is the 5-2 favorite in the 13-horse field.</p>
<h3>Times you need to know</h3>
<p>Then the real fun begins. The entire field of 20 Kentucky Derby horses and their connections -- the owners, trainers and jockeys -- will parade from the barn to the paddock beginning at 6:15 p.m. Riders will be called to mount their horses at 6:25 p.m., and the annual singing of "My Old Kentucky Home" soon follows. And at 6:34, the "fastest two minutes in sports" begins.</p>
<h4>142nd Kentucky Derby</h4>
<p><b>Walk from the barn:</b> 6:15 p.m.<br/><b>Post time: </b>6:34 p.m. ET <br/><b>TV: </b>NBC beginning at 4 p.m. <br/><b>Streaming: </b><a target="_blank" href="http://horsestream.nbcsports.com/">NBC Sports Live Extra</a></p>
<h4>Kentucky Derby undercard</h4>
<p><b>Post times: </b>First race at 10:30 a.m., 14 held throughout the day <br/><b>TV:</b> NBCSN beginning at noon <br/><b>Streaming:</b> <a href="http://horsestream.nbcsports.com/">NBC Sports Live Extra</a></p>


<h3>Here are the favorites</h3>
<p>When the gates open the crowd of more than 100,000 -- last year set a record 170,000-plus in attendance -- plus a large audience at home will be in for a treat. Although <b>Nyquist</b> was given 3-1 odds as <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/2016/5/4/11592642/2016-kentucky-derby-morning-line-odds" target="_blank">the morning line favorite</a> by oddsmaker Matt Battaglia, <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/2016/5/5/11596452/2016-kentucky-derby-horses-contenders-preview" target="_blank">he's not unbeatable</a>. We're pretty sure. A 7-for-7 start to his career, including a victory over then-undefeated Mahaymen at the Grade I Florida Derby, might indicate otherwise. Not to mention the 3-year-old colt trained by Doug O'Neill and jockeyed by Mario Gutierrez has already beaten all his chief competitors. However, he <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/2016/5/4/11592652/2016-kentucky-derby-post-positions-morning-line-odds" target="_blank">drew the 13th position</a> in the gate, which while far from the worst isn't the best.</p>
<p><b>Exaggerator </b>-- <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/2016/5/5/11601252/2016-kentucky-derby-exaggerator-keith-kent-desormeaux" target="_blank">trained by Keith Desormeaux and ridden by his brother and Hall of Fame jockey, Kent </a>-- has already suffered a defeat at the hands, er, hoofs, of Nyquist. That came at the closely contested Grade II San Vicente Stakes at Santa Anita in California. However Exaggerator, at 8-1 morning line odds and starting in the 11th position, has an impressive win of his own. He rallied from about 20 lengths back in the Grade I Santa Anita Derby on April 9 to blow by the field and win by 6 1/4 lengths. <b>Danzing Cand</b>y, another Derby contender, led the pack with a fast start before finishing fourth. Expect Danzing Candy to lead the Kentucky Derby at some point but he'll fade by the end.</p>
<p>Three horses were set at 10-1 odds. Those include <b>Creator</b>, winner of the Grade I Arkansas Derby; <b>Gun Runner</b>, who won several Grade II stakes races to earn the most points in the run up to the Derby without once competing in a Grade I race; and Mohaymen, whose only loss came to Nyquist at the Florida Derby.</p>
<p>There's one more to keep your eye on. Trainer Bob Baffert's entry, <b>Mor Spirit,</b> has Hall of Fame jockey Gary Stevens guiding him. His odds come in at 12-1 and he's starting from the 17th position, one that has never had a Derby victory. Baffert trained American Pharoah en route to a Triple Crown last year, and his charge is a <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/2016/5/5/11594904/2016-kentucky-derby-picks-predictions-nyquist-mor-spirit" target="_blank">dark horse picked by some experts to win </a>this year's Run for the Roses.</p>
