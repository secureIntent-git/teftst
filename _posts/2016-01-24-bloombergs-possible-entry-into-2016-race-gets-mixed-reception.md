Trump, a real estate mogul, is leading the Republican race.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Sanders has railed against "millionaires and billionaires" and the political power they wield throughout his insurgent campaign for the Democratic nomination.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>"That is not what, to my view, American democracy is supposed to be about, a contest between billionaires. If that takes place, I am confident that we will win it," Sanders said.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Many analysts believe a Bloomberg entry into the race could siphon Democratic votes and be another blow to Clinton, a former secretary of state and the wife of former President Bill Clinton.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>An independent bid would be a heavy lift for Bloomberg. The last major third-party candidate, Ross Perot, won 18.9 percent of the vote in 1992, which some observers believe enabled Bill Clinton to defeat then-incumbent President George H.W. Bush.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Hillary Clinton, who won the Register's endorsement on the Democratic side on Saturday, said she expected to negate Bloomberg's rationale for running.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>"He's a good friend of mine and I am going to do the best I can that I get the nomination and we'll go from there," she told NBC's "Meet the Press."</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>"The way I read what he said is that if I didn't get the nomination he would do it ... I will relieve him of that," she said.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Trump noted that he and Bloomberg have differences on the issues of gun control and abortion and that he would love to compete against him. Bloomberg wants more gun control and to preserve a woman's right to choose whether to have an abortion.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>"I know Michael very well and would love to compete with him. He is very opposite from me on guns and pro-life ... I would love to have Michael get in the race ... I would love to compete against Michael," Trump told CNN.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>The current mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio, was cool to a Bloomberg run on ABC’s "This Week."</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>“I don't think the people of the country want to give more money to billionaires at this point ... I don't think most Americans think billionaires are the ones who are going to help give us a more fair economy," he said.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><span id="midArticle_16"/><p> (Additional reporting by <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=juliaedwards&amp;">Julia Edwards</a> in Washington; Editing by Paul Simao)</p><span id="midArticle_17"/></div>
