The advocacy group is considering legal options as a result of the denial, he said.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>"She was in tears this morning," said Hooper, who said he spoke to the student's family. "She told the commandant that it was not fair for her to have to choose between her faith and attending The Citadel."</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The student, who has not been identified, lives outside of South Carolina, Hooper said.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Some current Citadel students and alumni had spoken out against allowing an exception, citing the military college's emphasis on uniformity in apparel and privileges. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Citadel students are required to wear uniforms furnished by the college at nearly all times except when the corps of cadets is furloughed or a cadet is on leave, according to the college's website.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Rosa said the student's request to wear the head scarf was given "considerable review" by the college, which considers requests for religious accommodations on a case-by-case basis.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Accommodations for prayer and dietary needs are commonly made, the school said. Several years ago, The Citadel allowed a cadet to wear long pants and a long-sleeved shirt during physical fitness training for religious reasons, Citadel spokesman Brett Ashworth said in a telephone interview.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>"We do everything we can to support our cadets," Ashworth said. </p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>In 2014, the U.S. Department of Defense gave troops more latitude to wear turbans, head scarfs, yarmulkes and other religious clothing with their uniforms unless it might affect military readiness or unit cohesion. </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Ashworth said the college is not governed by those rules.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><span id="midArticle_14"/><p> (Reporting by Harriet McLeod; Writing by Colleen Jenkins; Editing by Marguerita Choy and Dan Grebler)</p><span id="midArticle_15"/></div>
