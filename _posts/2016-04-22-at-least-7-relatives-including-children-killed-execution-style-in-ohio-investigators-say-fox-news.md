                <p><span style="color: #ED1C24;"><b>DEVELOPING:</b></span> A string of shootings, apparently "execution-style," killed at least seven Ohio family members, two of them children, investigators and local news agencies reported Friday.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>"This is not an active shooter situation, however no arrests have been made," Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine and Pike County Sheriff Charles Reader said in a joint statement. Investigators would not confirm whether a gunman was among the dead, but said they were conducting a series of search warrants.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>They discovered the remains in three different homes along the same road in Piketon. At least two babies, one of them 5 days old and the other 6 months old, lived in one of the homes, a Pike County victims' advocate <a href="http://www.chillicothegazette.com/story/news/local/2016/04/22/pike-county-mass-shooting-april-22/83380444/" target="_blank">told the Chillicothe Gazette.</a> He said many extended family members in the area were frightened for their safety.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>The family members who died had attended nearby Union Hill Church for years, according to Pastor Phil Fulton. "They kind of dropped by the wayside probably three, four years ago, maybe... The kids seemed friendly, always you know, just good kids, seemed like," the pastor told WKRC.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>Ohio's Bureau of Criminal Investigation sent more than a dozen agents to the scene, officials <a href="http://myfox28columbus.com/news/local/developing-several-people-reportedly-shot-in-pike-county" target="_blank">told Fox 28 in Columbus.</a></p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>The FBI in Cincinnati confirmed it offered help to the Pike County Sheriff's Office. Adams County Ohio Valley Schools briefly went on lockdown, <a href="http://www.fox19.com/story/31791838/multiple-fatalities-reported-in-pike-county" target="_blank">Fox 19 in Cincinnati adds</a>.</p>                
                

    
    
    
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" readability="5.1473684210526"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FBI?src=hash">#FBI</a> Cincinnati is closely monitoring the situation in Pike County and has offered assistance to the Pike County Sheriff's Office. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BREAKING?src=hash">#BREAKING</a></p>— FBI Cincinnati (@FBICincinnati) <a href="https://twitter.com/FBICincinnati/status/723536751684255746">April 22, 2016</a></blockquote>

    



            	 
            
                <p>Ohio Gov. John Kasich called the reports "tragic beyond comprehension."</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>The bureau sent crime scene investigators, special investigators, criminal intelligence agents and cyber crime investigators. Officials <a href="http://www.wlwt.com/news/multiple-fatalities-reported-at-pike-county-home/39162210" target="_blank">told WLWT</a> they sent so many agents because they weren't sure exactly what unfolded at the home.</p>                
                

            	 
            
                <p>Police closed off roads around the home as paramedics rushed to the area. Piketon is in the Appalachian region of Ohio, roughly 75 miles east of Cincinnati and 70 miles south of Columbus.</p>
