<span class="focusParagraph" readability="6"><p><span class="articleLocation">BEIRUT</span> Syria's opposition on Saturday said it had agreed to the "possibility" of a temporary truce, provided there were guarantees Damascus's allies including Russia would cease fire, sieges were lifted and aid deliveries were allowed country-wide.</p></span><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>But there was no immediate sign that Moscow would drop its vow to continue its onslaught against those it views as "terrorists" among the range of armed groups pitted against President Bashar al-Assad.    </p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>And Assad himself added his own conditions to any truce plan, saying on Saturday he was ready for a ceasefire on condition that "terrorists" did not use a lull in fighting to their advantage, and that countries backing insurgents halted support for them.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>He especially singled out neighboring Turkey. Throughout the five-year-old war, Damascus has routinely referred to all insurgents fighting the government and its allies as terrorists. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>To the frustration of the United States and its allies who support rebels trying to topple the president, Russian air strikes have turned the tide of the civil war in Assad's favor. </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Attempts to negotiate a truce in recent months have failed. The latest round of talks at the United Nations in Geneva is being jointly chaired by Russia and the United States. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>U.N. special envoy Staffan de Mistura said on Saturday the discussions were "intensive and constructive", Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reported.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>On Saturday, various Syrian opposition factions "expressed agreement on the possibility of reaching a temporary truce deal, to be reached through international mediation", a statement from the High Negotiations Committee said.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>But the Committee, which brings together a number of rebel groups and Syria's exiled political opposition, said the United Nations must guarantee "holding Russia and Iran and sectarian militias ... to a halt to fighting".</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>All sides should cease fire simultaneously and the Syrian government should release prisoners, it added.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>NUSRA FRONT IN SPOTLIGHT</p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>A source close to peace talks earlier told Reuters Syria's opposition had agreed to the idea of a two- to three-week truce.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>The truce would be renewable and supported by all parties except Islamic State, the source said. </p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>It would be conditional on the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front no longer being attacked by Syrian government forces and their allies, at least to start with, the source said.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>The Nusra Front is considered a terrorist organization by the U.N. Security Council.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>No halt to Russian bombardments looked immediately likely. The source close to peace talks said Russia had so far rejected the idea of halting attacks on Nusra.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia was "sticking to its consistent policy of rendering assistance and aid to the armed forces of Syria in their offensive actions against terrorists and against terrorist organizations".</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The source close to talks described the opposition's insistence on the Nusra Front no longer being targeted as "the elephant in the room". </p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>"They have to deal with this very delicately or they are going to end up with a civil war (among rebel groups) in Idlib on their hands," the source said. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Nusra fighters are fighting alongside other rebel groups in some areas, including Idlib.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry told his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov by phone on Saturday that Washington was deeply concerned about Russia's continued bombing of civilian targets, a State Department spokesman said.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><span id="midArticle_6"/>
