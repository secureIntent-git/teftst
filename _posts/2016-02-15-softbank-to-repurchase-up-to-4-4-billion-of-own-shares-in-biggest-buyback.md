<span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">TOKYO</span> Japanese telecoms conglomerate SoftBank Group (<span id="symbol_9984.T_0">9984.T</span>) on Monday announced its biggest ever buyback in a bid to boost investor confidence, saying it will purchase up to 500 billion yen ($4.4 billion) worth or as much as 14.2 percent of its own shares.</p></span><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>The stock has fallen over 37 percent year-on-year amid worries about SoftBank's outlook, including the future of loss-making U.S. wireless carrier Sprint Corp (<span id="symbol_S.N_1">S.N</span>), in which it has a majority stake.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The move follows its buyback of around $1 billion worth of shares in August, which Chief Executive Officer Masayoshi Son had said was partly in response to renewed confidence in Sprint.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>It also comes after SoftBank last week reported a better-than-expected 7.3 percent rise in third-quarter operating profit, as Sprint trimmed losses on subscriber gains and cost cuts.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Naoki Yokota, analyst at SMBC Friend Research Center Ltd, said investors will respond favorably to the buyback, which SoftBank has said will be carried out over a year starting on Wednesday.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>"SoftBank shares have become so cheap now. For the company to say it's buying back at this time will have an 'announcement effect'," he said, while adding that a full-fledged recovery  still depended on a turnaround at Sprint.  </p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
