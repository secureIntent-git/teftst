        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Obama has much in common with Trudeau, the progressive 44-year-old Liberal Party leader who took office in November. He replaced Conservative Stephen Harper, who had hectored the White House for years in a failed bid to push through U.S. approval for the Keystone XL oil pipeline.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Trudeau's official visit will be capped by a state dinner on Thursday, making him the first Canadian leader to be granted that honor since 1997.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>"Our great countries have been friends a long time. We grew up together ... and through it all, our enormous shared accomplishments speak for themselves," he said in reply to Obama.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>

Candidates on both the left and right have taken anti-free-trade positions.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Obama hopes to convince a reluctant U.S. Congress to ratify the sprawling Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact before he leaves office in January. Canada is also wrestling with the merits of the TPP.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><span id="midArticle_14"/><p> (Additional reporting by Timothy Gardner in Washington; Editing by Peter Cooney and James Dalgleish)</p><span id="midArticle_15"/></div>
