Mr. Trump has said that a victory in Indiana on Tuesday would effectively resolve the race in his favor.</p><figure id="media-100000004380119" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000004380119 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/03/us/03CAMPAIGN1/03CAMPAIGN1-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group"><span class="visually-hidden">Photo</span>

            </figcaption></figure><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="335" data-total-count="2803">At a concert hall in Carmel, near Indianapolis, on Monday, Mr. Trump again said that winning the state would end the Republican race, and interspersed his mockery of Mr. Cruz with harsh attacks on Hillary Clinton. “I’m going to start focusing on Hillary,” he said. “That’s going to be so easy. It’s going to be so great.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="358" data-total-count="3161">Paul Manafort, a senior adviser to Mr. Trump, said the Indiana vote would confirm Mr. Trump’s status as “the inevitable and presumptive nominee.” After Tuesday, Mr. Manafort said, the Trump campaign will increasingly turn its attention to preparing for the July convention in Cleveland and laying the organizational groundwork for the general election.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="187" data-total-count="3348">Mr. Manafort said it was past time for Mr. Trump’s rivals to bow to reality. “Cruz and Kasich should be doing what, historically, all losing candidates do,” he said. “Drop out.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="344" data-total-count="3692">On the Democratic side, polls suggest that Mrs. Clinton is in a close fight for Indiana with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Mr. Sanders’s populist message has broken through in several other states in the industrial heartland, including neighboring Michigan, and he could score an upset that would reinvigorate his demoralized supporters.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="286" data-total-count="3978">Campaigning Monday in Evansville, Ind., Mr. Sanders said he needed to record some big wins to become the nominee. Addressing a riled-up crowd, Mr. Sanders took aim at “the billionaire class,” prompting a supporter to cry out that the superrich should get lost, in earthier language.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="214" data-total-count="4192" id="story-continues-4">Laughing, Mr. Sanders replied that he was “constrained” from using such language. “I can’t quite phrase it like that, but that’s not bad,” he said. “You get to the point very succinctly. I like it.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="329" data-total-count="4521">If some voters remain passionately supportive of Mr. Sanders, the delegate math, however, is firmly against him. Mrs. Clinton has more than 90 percent of the 2,383 delegates needed for the nomination, including unpledged superdelegates who can change their affiliation. She has nearly 300 more pledged delegates than Mr. Sanders.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="173" data-total-count="4694">Still, Mrs. Clinton faces some tricky political terrain. After Indiana, the race moves to several states seen as friendly to Mr. Sanders, including West Virginia and Oregon.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="305" data-total-count="4999">Protesters greeted Mrs. Clinton in West Virginia on Monday and criticized her for a recent statement seeming to cheer the decline of the coal industry. Mrs. Clinton told a crowd there that she regretted her remark, but that it had been misinterpreted and had most likely harmed her in the coal-rich state.</p><figure id="media-100000004380180" class="media photo embedded layout-large-horizontal media-100000004380180 ratio-tall" data-media-action="modal" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemid="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/03/us/03campaign-web/03campaign-web-master675.jpg" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" aria-label="media" role="group"><span class="visually-hidden">Photo</span>

Mr. Trump trails Mrs. Clinton in general election polls, and party leaders fear that his unpopularity would drag down their candidates for the Senate and House of Representatives.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="240" data-total-count="5717">But as Mr. Trump has gained strength in the nominating fight, winning primaries by widening margins, some Republicans have grown apprehensive about mounting an all-out war against him, given the growing likelihood that he will be nominated.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="356" data-total-count="6073">Mr. Trump’s adversaries have pursued a range of unlikely strategies against him as the odds of defeating him have faded almost to the point of evaporation. The forces arrayed against Mr. Trump staked their hopes first on Wisconsin, where <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/us/politics/republican-primary-results.html">Mr. Cruz soundly defeated him</a>, and then on Indiana, another Midwestern state where Mr. Trump was seen as vulnerable.</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="316" data-total-count="6389" id="story-continues-5">Mr. Cruz, a hard-line conservative who has struggled to rally the Republican establishment to his side, has seemed to deploy every available tactic to block Mr. Trump in the state, including forming a brief alliance with Mr. Kasich and naming Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard executive, as his running mate.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="225" data-total-count="6614">Groups opposed to Mr. Trump have spent $2 million on television ads attacking him in Indiana, and on Friday, Mr. Cruz collected an endorsement from Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican who is popular among conservative voters there.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="246" data-total-count="6860">If the anti-Trump effort in Indiana falls short, said Robert Blizzard, a Republican pollster, “it will be increasingly difficult for either Senator Cruz or Governor Kasich to make an argument in upcoming primary contests they can stop Trump.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="235" data-total-count="7095">Mr. Blizzard, who worked for a “<a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/campaign_finance/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about Super PACs." class="meta-classifier">super PAC</a>” supporting Jeb Bush’s campaign, said an Indiana defeat for the anti-Trump forces would prompt Republicans to turn their attention to shoring up the rest of the party for a fall campaign.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="263" data-total-count="7358">“There’s no doubt we’re going to face an uphill general election contest with Trump at the top of the ticket,” he said, “and it’s time to figure out how our candidates, from U.S. Senate to Congress to state legislature, compete on that battlefield.”</p><a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#whats-next">Continue reading the main story</a>
