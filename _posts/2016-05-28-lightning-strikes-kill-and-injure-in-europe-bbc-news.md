Such storms produce intense rainfall, hail, and numerous lightning strikes and it is typical for them to be at their most widespread and intense in the early afternoon. They are not unusual over the continent during the summer, although today's outbreaks were perhaps more widespread than normal.</p><p>Further storms are likely over Europe on Sunday: the areas expected to see the storms are southern and eastern Germany, the Czech Republic, and the western half of Poland. </p><p>In addition to the widespread nature of today's storms, the fact that they came at a weekend, and during otherwise fine, warm weather, made it more likely that they would have an impact on people.</p><p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23621324" class="story-body__link">How do you recover from being struck by lightning?</a></p><hr class="story-body__line"/><p><strong>Are you in the area?
