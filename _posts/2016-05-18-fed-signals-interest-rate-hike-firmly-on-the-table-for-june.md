<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">WASHINGTON</span> U.S. Federal Reserve officials said it would appropriate to raise interest rates in June if economic data points to stronger second-quarter growth as well as firming inflation and employment, according to minutes from their policy meeting last month.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>That view, expressed by most of the Fed's policy-setting committee at the April 26-27 meeting, suggests the U.S. central bank is closer to lifting rates again than Wall Street had expected.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The policymakers said recent data made them more confident inflation was rising toward the Fed's 2 percent target, and that they were less concerned about a global economic slowdown, according to the minutes, which were released on Wednesday. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"Most participants judged that if incoming data were consistent with economic growth picking up in the second quarter, labor markets continued to strengthen, and inflation making progress toward the committee's 2 percent objective, then it likely would be appropriate for the committee to increase the target range for the federal funds rate in June," according to the minutes.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Prices for futures contracts on the Fed's benchmark overnight lending rate implied that investors saw a 34 percent chance of a rate increase next month, up from 19 percent shortly before the release of the minutes, according to CME Group.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>U.S. stocks pared gains and the dollar .DXY extended gains against a basket of currencies after the minutes were released. Treasury yields rose, with the yield on 30-year U.S. government debt rising to a two-week high.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>"They are ready to pull the trigger on a rate increase in June," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Some policymakers at the April meeting expressed concern about a slowdown in U.S. economic growth during the first quarter, when gross domestic product expanded at an annual rate of 0.5 percent, a two-year low. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>But others argued that ongoing robust job growth suggested the economy had not gone off the track and that the growth data could be flawed.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>"Most pointed to the steady improvement in the labor market as an indicator that the underlying pace of economic activity had likely not deteriorated," according to the minutes.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Some policymakers said they were concerned financial markets could be roiled by a possible British exit from the European Union in a vote next month or by China's exchange rate policies.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>At its April meeting, the Fed kept its target overnight interest rate in a range of 0.25 percent to 0.50 percent. It hiked rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>A global equities sell-off and the tightening of financial markets earlier this year largely due to concerns of a slowdown in China prompted the Fed in March to dial back rate increase  expectations for the year.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Even so, the Fed signaled at that time that it would likely lift rates twice this year. Investors have been betting on just one hike.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><span id="midArticle_15"/><p> (Reporting by Jason Lange and Lindsay Dunsmuir; Additional reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak in New York; Editing by Paul Simao)</p><span id="midArticle_16"/></div>
