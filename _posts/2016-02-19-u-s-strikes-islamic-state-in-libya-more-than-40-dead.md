<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">TRIPOLI</span> U.S. warplanes carried out air strikes against Islamic State-linked militants in western Libya on Friday, killing as many as 40 people in an operation targeting a suspect linked to two deadly attacks last year in neighboring Tunisia.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>It was the second U.S. air strike in three months against Islamic State in Libya, where the hardline Islamist militants have exploited years of chaos following Muammar Gaddafi's 2011 overthrow to build up a presence on the southern shores of the Mediterranean Sea.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The Pentagon said it had targeted an Islamic State training camp and killed a Tunisian militant linked to major attacks on tourists in Tunisia.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The mayor of the Libyan city of Sabratha, Hussein al-Thwadi, told Reuters the planes struck at 3:30 a.m. (0130 GMT), hitting a building in the city's Qasr Talil district, home to many foreigners. </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>He said 41 people had been killed and six wounded. The death toll could not immediately be confirmed with other officials.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Photos released by the municipal authorities showed a massive crater in grey earth. Several wounded men lay bandaged in hospital.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The air strikes targeted a house in a residential district about 8 km (5 miles) west of the center, the municipal authorities said in a statement.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>The house had been rented to foreigners including Tunisians suspected of belonging to Islamic State, and medium-caliber weapons including machineguns and rocket-propelled grenades had been found in the rubble, the statement said.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Tunisian security sources have said they believe Tunisian Islamic State fighters have been trained in camps near Sabratha, which is close to the Tunisian border.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Among those Washington said it targeted in the air strikes was Noureddine Chouchane, a Tunisian blamed by his native country for attacks last year on a Tunis museum and the Sousse beach resort, which killed dozens of tourists.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"Destruction of the camp and Chouchane's removal will eliminate an experienced facilitator and is expected to have an immediate impact on ISIL's ability to facilitate its activities in Libya, including recruiting new ISIL members, establishing bases in Libya, and potentially planning external attacks on U.S. interests in the region," the Pentagon said, using an acronym for Islamic State, also known as ISIS or Daesh.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>The air strikes came just days after a warning by President Barack Obama that Washington intended to "take actions where we've got a clear operation and a clear target in mind".</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>"And we are working with our coalition partners to make sure that as we see opportunities to prevent ISIS from digging in, in Libya, we take them," Obama said on Tuesday.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Britain said it had authorized the use of its airbases to launch the attack.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>“I welcome this strike that has taken out a Daesh training camp being used to train terrorists to carry out attacks," Defense Secretary Michael Fallon said in a statement.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>"I was satisfied that its destruction makes us all safer, and I personally authorized the U.S. use of our bases.”</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>Islamic State runs a self-styled caliphate across swathes of Iraq and Syria, where it has faced air strikes from a U.S.-led coalition since 2014.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Thwadi, the Sabratha mayor, said some Tunisians, a Jordanian and two women were among the dead, and several Tunisians who had recently arrived in Sabratha were among survivors. He gave no further details.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>DEEPER INTO CHAOS</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Since Gaddafi was overthrown five years ago by rebel forces backed by a campaign of NATO air strikes, Libya has slipped deeper into chaos, with two rival governments each backed by competing factions of former rebel brigades.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>A U.N.-backed government of national accord is trying to win support, but is still awaiting parliamentary approval. It is opposed by factional hardliners and has yet to establish itself in the capital Tripoli.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Meanwhile, Islamic State has expanded, attacking oil ports and taking over Gaddafi's home city of Sirte, now the militant group's most important stronghold outside its main redoubts in Syria and Iraq. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Calls have increased for a swift Western response to stop the group establishing itself more permanently and using Libya as a base for attacks on neighbors Tunisia and Egypt.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Western officials and diplomats have said air strikes and special forces operations are possible as well as an Italian-led "security stabilization" plan of training and advising.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>U.S. and European officials have in the past insisted Libyans must first form a united government and ask for help, but they also say they may still carry out unilateral action if needed.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Last November the United States said it carried out an air strike on Derna, a town on the opposite side of Libya close to the Egyptian border, to target Abu Nabil, also known as Wissam Najm Abd Zayd al Zubaydi, an Iraqi commander in Islamic State.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Last June, a U.S. air strike targeted veteran Algerian militant Mokhtar Belmokhtar and other jihadists meeting in the eastern Libyan city of Ajdabiya. His fate is unclear.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><p> (Additional reporting by Warren Strobel in Washington; writing by Dominic Evans and Peter Graff; editing by Patrick Markey, Alison Williams and Andrew Roche)</p><span id="midArticle_14"/></div>
