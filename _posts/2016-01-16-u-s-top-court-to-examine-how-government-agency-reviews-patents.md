<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocation">NEW YORK</span> The U.S. Supreme Court will consider whether a federal agency's procedures have made it too easy to successfully cancel patents after agreeing on Friday to decide a case involving a vehicle speedometer that alerts drivers if they are speeding.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The nine justices will hear an appeal filed by Cuozzo Speed Technologies LLC, whose speedometer patent was invalidated in a U.S. Patent and Trademark Office review procedure after being challenged by GPS device maker Garmin Ltd (<span id="symbol_GRMN.O_0">GRMN.O</span>) in 2012.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Companies that are frequent targets of patent suits, including Apple Inc (<span id="symbol_AAPL.O_1">AAPL.O</span>) and Google Inc (<span id="symbol_GOOGL.O_2">GOOGL.O</span>), have taken advantage of the patent office procedure, known as inter partes review (IPR), in unexpectedly high numbers since it was put in place in 2012. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>These reviews allow anyone to challenge the validity of a patent far more cheaply and quickly than in a U.S. federal court. </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The high court justices will now consider whether the patent office is improperly interpreting the patents that come before it in the reviews. Critics say this leads to a high rate of patent cancellations.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>New Jersey-based Cuozzo told the Supreme Court the procedure was "surprisingly lethal," noting that in nearly 85 percent of cases some or all of the patent claims challenged have been canceled.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>If the patent office does not change course, it would allow hundreds or even thousands of additional patent claims to be "invalidated under the wrong standard," Cuozzo said in court papers.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Jeffrey Wall, an attorney for Cuozzo, said he was pleased the high court will examine the case.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>The agency had asked the court not to hear Cuozzo's appeal, saying in court papers any changes to its procedures should be made by Congress.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>A ruling is due by the end of June.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Cuozzo was supported by several industry groups and companies, which urged the justices to take the case.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>One friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of 3M Co(<span id="symbol_MMM.N_3">MMM.N</span>), Caterpillar Inc(<span id="symbol_CAT.N_4">CAT.N</span>), Eli Lilly and Co(<span id="symbol_LLY.N_5">LLY.N</span>) and Qualcomm Inc (<span id="symbol_QCOM.O_6">QCOM.O</span>) said the patent office reviews and litigation in district court needed to be streamlined for the "proper functioning of the patent system as a whole."</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>The cancellation of Cuozzo's patent came in the first-ever petition for an IPR. Garmin's action was in response to a lawsuit filed by Cuozzo in federal court in 2012. Garmin is no longer involved in the case. </p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>A spokesman for the patent office declined to comment.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>The case is In re Cuozzo Speed Technologies LLC v Michelle K. Lee, in the Supreme Court of the United States, No. 15-446.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><span id="midArticle_16"/><p> (Reporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=will.dunham&amp;">Will Dunham</a>)</p><span id="midArticle_17"/></div>
