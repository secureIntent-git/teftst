At least 10 Israeli soldiers also were wounded during the hour-long operation.</p> <p>According to initial Israeli reports, the two soldiers said they had been using Waze, a highly touted Israeli-invented navigation app bought two years ago by Google. The smartphone app, which has a settings option to “avoid dangerous areas,” relies on crowd sourcing to give users the fastest traffic routes.</p> <p channel="wp.com" class="interstitial-link"> <i>[<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/01/27/why-some-cops-hate-waze-the-app-highway-drivers-love/">Why some American cops hate Waze</a>]</i> </p> <p>But in places where the app is not widely used — such as the Palestinian villages surrounding Jerusalem and in the West Bank — the service could face limitations.</p> <p>The AFP news agency quoted a Waze official as saying the device setting to warn about areas “dangerous or prohibited for Israelis to drive through” was off.</p> <p>“In this case, the setting was disabled. In addition, the driver deviated from the suggested route and as a result, entered the prohibited area,” the official told AFP.</p> <p>Israeli army spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said the two soldiers were from a non-combat unit and had been relying on a satellite navigation app that led them into the Palestinian refugee camp by mistake. He did not specifically say whether the soldiers were using the Waze system.</p> <p>It remained unclear how the soldiers could have stumbled into the middle of the camp, sandwiched between Jerusalem and Ramallah. To reach Qalandiya, the soldiers would have had to pass by the so-called separation barrier and through an Israeli checkpoint.</p> <p>There, they were “stormed by a mob of people with rocks and Molotov cocktails,” Lerner said. Their jeep was blocked from turning around and caught fire. The soldiers fled in separate directions.</p> <p>One of the soldiers had a mobile phone and within 30 minutes was located by several back up units of soldiers and Israeli police. The second soldier was found an hour later in the vicinity of an Israeli settlement. </p> <p>While the search operation was underway, a firefight broke out with armed Palestinians in the camp.</p> <p channel="wp.com" class="interstitial-link"> <i>[<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/google-waze-make-it-official-with-acquisition-announcement/2013/06/11/f75bc79a-d2ac-11e2-8cbe-1bcbee06f8f8_story.html">Google maps out strategy with Waze</a>]</i> </p> <p>During the rescue operation, Lerner said that troops on the ground initiated the Hannibal protocol, allowing soldiers to raise the level of alert, increase the number of forces in the area and “carry out an extraction as fast as possible in order to end the incident.”</p> <p>The protocol has often been criticized as it allows for extraordinary military measures in order to prevent soldiers from being abducted.</p> <p>Palestinian sources reported that at least 10 Qalandiya residents were injured during the clashes and 22 year-old Iyad Omar Sajadiyya, a student at Al-Quds University, was killed.</p> <p>The Washington Post’s West Bank correspondent Sufian Taha, who witnessed the battle, described Qalandiya as a “war zone.”</p> <p>“There was a lot traffic and you could hear the shooting like rain falling. Bullets were coming from every direction,” he said. “Suddenly a large number of soldiers arrived and about 20 armored jeeps entered the camp.”</p> <p>In an interview on Israel Radio, a former military commander of the area, Gadi Shamni, said the Qalandiya refugee camp was a symbol of Palestinian resistance and that it had become a no man’s land, where neither the Palestinian Authority nor the Israeli authorities were in control.</p> <p>“This vacuum attracts violent gangs and a lot of armed people. There are incidents of shooting almost every evening in Qalandiya, certainly when the [Israeli military] enters,” he said.</p> <p>Tension between Israelis and Palestinians has been running high over the past five months, with almost daily stabbing, shooting and vehicular attacks by Palestinians against Israelis leaving at least 29 Israeli citizens and three foreign nationals dead.</p> <p>Also, more than 165 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis, most while carrying out attacks against Israelis and the rest during clashes with the Israeli military.</p>        </article> <div class="post-body-sig-line" readability="33"><p>Ruth Eglash is a reporter for The Washington Post based in Jerusalem.
