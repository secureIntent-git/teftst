<span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocation">CARACAS</span> Venezuela's opposition and top government officials said on Saturday they met with a group of mediators in the Dominican Republic to lay the groundwork for a dialogue amid a political standoff and a deepening economic crisis.</p></span><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>The OPEC nation is suffering a severe recession due to low oil prices and a collapsing socialist economic model. President Nicolas Maduro is locked in a standoff with the legislature after the opposition won a sweeping majority last year.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Both sides said they met with former Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero and former presidents Martin Torrijos of Panama and Leonel Fernandez of the Dominican Republic. On Friday, the U.S. State Department announced Secretary of State John Kerry had spoken to Zapatero to welcome the initiative and said that the United States stood ready to help the mediators..</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The opposition's Democratic Unity coalition said its representatives told the mediators that any talks with the government would have to include discussion of a recall referendum on Maduro's rule, the release of jailed opposition leaders, foreign humanitarian assistance to cope with chronic shortages and respect for laws passed by the congress. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"These points were taken by the ex-presidents to the representatives of the ruling party, with whom there has been no direct encounter whatsoever," the coalition said in a statement. "This has been an encounter with the mediators.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>

Maduro insists his government is the victim of an "economic war" led by business leaders with the backing of Washington, which has been an ideological adversary of Caracas since the presidency of late socialist leader Hugo Chavez.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><span id="midArticle_12"/><p> (Reporting by Brian Ellsworth; Additional reporting by Andrew Cawthorne; Editing by Gareth Jones and W Simon)</p><span id="midArticle_13"/></div>
