The manager, who did not want to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly, sold all of his shares in the company. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Shares of Apple fell 6.5 percent on Jan. 27, the day after the company reported its slowest-ever rise in iPhone shipments and forecast quarterly sales declining for the first time in 13 years.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The stock dipped 0.7 percent to $105.32 on Thursday.  </p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>With the higher concentration of hedge funds owning the stock, Apple should brace for more activist calls to raise its dividend, offer more share buybacks, or acquire more companies to increase short-term returns, said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at S&amp;P Capital IQ.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>"Your typical mutual fund manager is going to have more patience than your typical hedge fund manager, who if they have a sizeable stake are going to push for structural or corporate changes to enhance shareholder value," he said. </p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Hedge fund Bridgewater Associates increased its stake in Apple by 19 percent during the fourth quarter of 2015, while Tiger Global Management initiated a position, buying 10.6 million shares in the same period, according to SEC filings.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>At the same time, well-known activists such as Carl Icahn and David Einhorn have trimmed their positions.. </p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Hedge fund manager Morris Mark, whose firm Mark Asset Management oversees $500 million in assets, said he is maintaining a large position in Apple, even as the shares flat line. He sees the iPhone as the gateway into new home-based products. </p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>"They're going to come out with more services layered on top of this incredible franchise, and you are going to see their entire ecosystem grow," he said.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><span id="midArticle_1"/><p> (Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)</p><span id="midArticle_2"/></div>
