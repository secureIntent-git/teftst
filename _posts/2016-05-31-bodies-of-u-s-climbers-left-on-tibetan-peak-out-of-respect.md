        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Steck and Goettler, who had heard about the disappearance of the legendary climbers on the same route 16 years ago, descended to their advanced base camp, set up at 18,700 feet (5,700 m).</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Goettler called Conrad Anker, who was part of the 1999 expedition and survived the avalanche, describing their findings.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>"We did not know them and we could not recognize them," Steck said, outside his hotel in Kathmandu.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Based on the description, Anker had little doubt of the identities of the two bodies, as their clothing, boots and backpacks matched the gear Lowe and Bridges had when they disappeared.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>"We did not touch them out of respect and left the bodies on the mountain in the same position as we had discovered (them)," said the 40-year-old mountaineer from Interlaken, Switzerland.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Bodies of climbers who perish in the Himalayas remain buried under the snow and emerge as the ice melts or glaciers move.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
