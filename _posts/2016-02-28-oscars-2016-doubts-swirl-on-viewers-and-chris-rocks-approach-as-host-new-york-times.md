Within shouting distance of the red carpet, demonstrators are expected to call for a boycott later Sunday afternoon. In the morning, the Rev. Al Sharpton gave a fiery Oscar-related sermon at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church here, promising wrath on advertisers if they continued to support a monoracial Academy Awards telecast.</p><aside class="marginalia collection-marginalia collection collection-type-column collection-tone-feature collection-section-movies collection-theme-latest-headlines nocontent robots-nocontent" role="complementary"><!-- close nocontent -->

Will this year’s acid-tongued host, Chris Rock, dismantle Hollywood over the diversity issue or find a way forward? Will viewers be drawn by the controversy, and how it will be addressed by presenters and winners? Or will viewers point their remote controls elsewhere, not wishing to spend a Sunday night being lectured?</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="447" data-total-count="2354" itemprop="articleBody">In all, it is a far cry from a time when Hollywood lived its own illusions — as in, say, 1937, when George Jessel, an ex-vaudevillian, played host to the moguls and stars who came to see “The Great Ziegfeld” honored at that year’s ceremony. Caught in a panoramic photo at the Biltmore Hotel here, Henry Fonda schmoozed with Mervyn LeRoy. A smug Cecil B. DeMille stood guard. Martha Raye thumbed her nose at the camera: Take us or leave us.</p><div id="Moses" class="ad moses-ad nocontent robots-nocontent">

Biden Jr. Mr. Biden was expected to introduce Lady Gaga’s performance of “Til It Happens to You,” an Oscar-nominated song from “The Hunting Ground,” a documentary about sexual assault.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="280" data-total-count="3042" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-5">In a politically charged year, even Mr. Biden’s appearance carried some risk: Many viewers, wary of any political bent to the show, had bitterly objected when the first lady, Michelle Obama, presented the best picture trophy to “Argo” by remote from the White House in 2013.</p> <figure id="oscar-predictions" class="interactive promo  has-adjacency layout-large"><a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-6">Continue reading the main story</a>

Rooney Mara, a supporting-actress nominee for “Carol,” promised to attend. But “I hate, hate, hate that I am on that side of the whitewashing conversation,” Ms. Mara <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/film/carol/rooney-mara-interview/">told a British newspaper</a>, referring to <a href="http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Why-White-Tiger-Lily-Works-According-Rooney-Mara-70870.html">a racial blowup</a> over her having been cast as Tiger Lily in “Pan.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="245" data-total-count="3900" itemprop="articleBody">Among those who actually are avoiding the ceremony are Spike Lee, the director who just three months ago was presented an honorary Oscar at the academy’s Governors Awards ceremony, and the actors Jada Pinkett Smith and her husband, Will Smith.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="140" data-total-count="4040" itemprop="articleBody">Self-mortification and diversity aside, Hollywood’s awards year was remarkable for its confusion, especially in the best-picture category.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="257" data-total-count="4297" itemprop="articleBody">Several influential Hollywood guilds, usually a reliable indicator of Oscar prospects, split their top awards among three contenders.

</figure><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="597" data-total-count="5213" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-7">Handicappers are facing thorny questions right up to show time. Will Mr. DiCaprio’s almost certain grasp of the best-actor award — which would be his first Oscar after four previous nominations — actually undercut the film’s chance at best picture, if voters decided that was enough and looked elsewhere to award other prizes? Will last year’s best-picture win for “Birdman,” also directed by Mr. Iñárritu, now work against him? (No director in Oscar history has ever had back-to-back best pictures, though two, John Ford and Joseph L. Mankiewicz, won successive directing awards.)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="266" data-total-count="5479" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-8">It is possible that female voters balked at “The Revenant,” a bloody frontier revenge story, complete with a bear mauling, and will break instead toward “Spotlight,” or even toward “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/19/movies/holding-out-hope-for-room-to-win-the-oscar-for-best-picture.html">Room</a>,” which starred Brie Larson, a favorite for the best-actress award.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="618" data-total-count="6097" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-9">What passes for suspense on the ballot’s lower reaches are issues unlikely to keep viewers from drifting over to AMC for a peek at “The Walking Dead.” One question is whether George Miller’s “Mad Max: Fury Road,” with 10 nominations, will pick off some craft awards otherwise inclined toward “The Revenant.” Another question looms in the documentary feature category: Will “What Happened, Miss Simone?,” a lavishly campaigned-for Netflix documentary with a black subject in an overwhelmingly white year, find success at the expense of “Amy,” about the rise and fall of the singer Amy Winehouse?</p><div id="MiddleRight2" class="ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

In an unusual show of force, the studio and its subsidiaries have landed three nominations for best picture. They are “The Revenant,” made by New Regency Pictures and others and distributed by Fox; “The Martian,” directed by Ridley Scott with Matt Damon in the lead role; and “Brooklyn,” from the Fox Searchlight unit, with Saoirse Ronan in the lead.

Price increases and added commercial minutes pushed ABC’s revenue from the show to about $110 million last year, up 62 percent from a recent low of $68 million in 2009, Kantar reported.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="285" data-total-count="7819" itemprop="articleBody">To protect those gains against future rollbacks, ABC and the academy must get the audience back up — with <a href="http://variety.com/2014/film/awards/oscars-ellen-degeneres-host-academy-awards-billy-crystal-1201124477/">the blockbuster 2014 ceremony</a>, hosted by a pizza-dispensing Ellen DeGeneres and produced by Neil Meron and Craig Zadan, as one benchmark. That evening drew 43.7 million viewers.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="296" data-total-count="8115" itemprop="articleBody">On Sunday, the task falls largely to Mr. Rock, who has pushed hard in recent years to return as host (he was M.C. in 2005) only to find himself with a nearly impossible task. Some producers here likened his challenge to the time that Ms. DeGeneres <a href="http://deadline.com/2013/08/ellen-degeneres-2001-emmys-opening-555866/">hosted the Emmy Awards</a> in the aftermath of 9/11.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="192" data-total-count="8307" itemprop="articleBody">“I hope he skewers everybody,” said Don Cheadle, an Oscar nominee for “Hotel Rwanda” in 2005, while attending <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/movies/black-actors-ready-chris-rock-shake-oscar-show-192311498.html">the American Black Film Festival Honors</a> show in Beverly Hills last Sunday.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="76" data-total-count="8383" itemprop="articleBody">Since he can’t please everybody, that, for Mr. Rock, may be the best hope.</p>
