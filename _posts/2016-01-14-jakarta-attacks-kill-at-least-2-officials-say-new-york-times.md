The arrests kept on snowballing,” Mr. Conboy said. “They were supposedly planning attacks on police stations, Shiite Muslim communities and maybe the national Police Headquarters” in Jakarta.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="145" data-total-count="5810" itemprop="articleBody">Mr. Conboy said there was no indication that the suspects recently arrested were connected to Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS or ISIL.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="175" data-total-count="5985" itemprop="articleBody">“The police are extra vigilant about saying ISIS these days, but there was no indication that the people picked up were linked to ISIS or had allegiance to ISIS,” he said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="374" data-total-count="6359" itemprop="articleBody">Jalan Thamrin, where the attack occurred Thursday, is the main thoroughfare through central Jakarta, and the attack took place just yards from Plaza Sarinah, the city’s oldest modern shopping mall. The mall is one of the few landmarks President Obama recognized as his motorcade rolled through Jakarta during his <a title="Times article." href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/world/asia/10prexy.html">2010 state visit</a> to the capital, where he <a title="Times article." href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/09/world/asia/09indo.html">lived as a child</a>.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="443" data-total-count="6802" itemprop="articleBody">Numerous high-rise buildings, including offices occupied by the United Nations, lie within yards of the police post that was the apparent target of the attack, as well as several four- and five-star hotels and Tanah Abang, Southeast Asia’s largest traditional textiles market. The United States Embassy is a little over half a mile from the attack site, which is also near Indonesia’s National Monument and the presidential palace complex.</p>
