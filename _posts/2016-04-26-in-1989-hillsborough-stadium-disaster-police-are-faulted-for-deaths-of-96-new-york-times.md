After the verdict, however, the Crown Prosecution Service said it was evaluating whether to press charges in light of the findings, and legal experts said that such a case would most likely focus on Mr. Duckenfield.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="279" data-total-count="4085">During the inquest Mr. Duckenfield described how he “froze” during the vital moments when police officers responded to the overcrowding threat and did not foresee that his failure to close a tunnel leading to crowded pens after a large exit gate was opened would prove fatal.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="321" data-total-count="4406">In the days after the deaths, efforts by the police to assign responsibility to soccer fans culminated in a story in the British newspaper The Sun under the headline “The Truth.” It blamed Liverpool fans for bad behavior and said they had attacked rescue workers, urinated on police officers and pickpocketed victims.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="87" data-total-count="4493">The Sun’s editor at the time, Kelvin MacKenzie, <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/sun_says/4538139/The-Sun-says-We-are-sorry-for-our-gravest-error.html"> apologized</a> more than 23 years later.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="217" data-total-count="4710">In 1996, a former spokesman for Margaret Thatcher, who had been prime minister at the time of the stadium deaths, wrote a letter to Graham Skinner, a Liverpool fan whose friend had died in the crush, blaming the fans.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="205" data-total-count="4915">“I believe that there would have been no Hillsborough disaster if tanked-up yobs had not turned up in very large numbers to try to force their way into the ground,” <a href="http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/sir-bernard-ingham-1996-letter-3324915">wrote the spokesman, Bernard Ingham</a>.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="191" data-total-count="5106">Mr. Duckenfield, who is now 71, left the police force at the age of 46 and retired to the south coast, where, according to the British news media, he disappeared largely from the public view.</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

The jury voted 7 to 2 on that question.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="237" data-total-count="6215">A new inquest into the disaster was ordered after an independent panel concluded in September 2012 that there had been a <a href="http://hillsborough.independent.gov.uk/repository/report/HIP_report.pdf">vast cover-up</a> in which senior police offers sought to dissemble blame by making scapegoats of victims and survivors.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="110" data-total-count="6325">In December of that year, a high court in London <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/20/sports/soccer/british-authorities-order-new-investigation-of-hillsborough-disaster.html">overturned the original inquest verdicts</a> of accidental death.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="262" data-total-count="6587">The independent panel’s report, citing post-mortem reports, said the coroner had assigned an arbitrary time of death for 41 victims, even as their heart and lungs continued to function. Some members of the victims’ families fainted when they read the report.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="157" data-total-count="6744">When the 2012 report was published, Mr. Cameron issued a government apology to the families of the victims, saying that they had suffered a double injustice.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="261" data-total-count="7005">“The injustice of the appalling events, the failure of the state to protect their loved ones and the indefensible wait to get to the truth,” and “the injustice of the denigration of the deceased — that they were somehow at fault for their own deaths.”</p><div id="story-ad-4" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

Fifty-six people were killed when a fire raced through the stands during a Bradford City soccer match on May 11, 1985. Less than three weeks later, 39 people were crushed to death at Heysel Stadium in Brussels before the start of the European Cup final between Liverpool and the Italian club Juventus.</p><div id="addenda" class="addenda" readability="8">

        <strong> Correction: April 26, 2016 </strong> <p>Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to David Duckenfield. He was the South Yorkshire officer in charge of security for the match in 1989, not the chief of police.</p>    </div>
