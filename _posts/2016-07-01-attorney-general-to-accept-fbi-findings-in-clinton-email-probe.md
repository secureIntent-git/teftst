        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The private meeting took place on Lynch's plane after she landed in Phoenix on Monday night and Bill Clinton was leaving the airport after a rally for his wife earlier that day.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Lynch, appointed by Democratic U.S. President Barack Obama,  told reporters earlier this week that she did not discuss the email investigation or other pending matters before the Justice Department with Bill Clinton, calling their meeting "primarily social." </p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation is probing Clinton's email use and whether laws were broken as a result of a personal email server kept in her Chappaqua, New York, home while she was secretary of state, an issue that has overshadowed her campaign.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Clinton last year apologized for using the server, saying that while she did nothing wrong, she should have used two email accounts: one for State Department business and another for personal matters.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Representatives for her campaign could not be reached immediately for comment on Friday. </p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Clinton's likely rival in the presidential race, Republican Donald Trump, on Thursday called Lynch's meeting "a sneak" and questioned the judgment of both Bill Clinton and the attorney general.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Trump, in a tweet on Friday, said the meeting showed the U.S. political system was "totally rigged" and that Hillary Clinton had bad judgment. </p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>"Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!" Trump said on Twitter.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>The Justice Department, along with the White House, has said the probe should be free of political interference.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><span id="midArticle_16"/><p> (Reporting by Julia Edwards and Adam DeRose; Writing by Susan Heavey; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Jonathan Oatis)</p><span id="midArticle_17"/></div>
