<br><div id="start-of-content"><p>Never pick a fight, the saying used to go, with anyone who buys ink by the barrel. That was the press, back when journalism used actual, you know, presses. Can you imagine?!</p>
<p>Then, nobody needed ink anymore. We use bandwidth now—like, right now, if you are reading this, which you are, for now—and compete furiously for eyeballs, which would have been a disgusting thing to say 15 years ago.</p>
<p>But all the way back to the barrels-full-of-ink days, one thing was true: If you were a wealthy person, you could buy your own press and influence your own news. For just about every example of a rich dude—really, it’s almost always dudes—who decides it’d be fun to run a news organization, another one is running one into the ground. The Thiel Disruption is a new wrinkle: how a venture capitalist discovered that he could nuisance-sue a news organization into oblivion. Innovative!</p>
<p>The worst part is the sad emptiness of the northwest quadrant of our carefully researched (ahem) chart. Why can’t a billionovative disruptonnaire  figure out how to save the press by leaving it the hell alone?</p>
