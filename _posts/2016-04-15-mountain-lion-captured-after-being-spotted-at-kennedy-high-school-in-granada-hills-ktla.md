<p>A mountain lion that was first spotted Friday at John F. Kennedy High School in Granada Hills and led authorities on a short chase to a nearby home has been tranquilized and apprehended by authorities.</p>

<p>The initial sighting occurred around 7 a.m. near the campus, which is located at 11254 Gothic Ave., a school employee told KTLA.</p>
<p>The school -- whose mascot happens to be the "golden cougars" --was placed on lockdown following a report that the mountain lion was seen roaming on the campus before noon.</p>
<p>After it went into effect, authorities went around the campus as they worked to confirm the reported puma sighting.</p>
<p>Around 12:30 p.m., armed officers could be seen with guns drawn as they searched a school patio for the mountain lion, aerial video showed.</p>

<p>Less than 10 minutes later, the cougar was spotted sitting on a school fence, according to Sky5 footage.</p>
<p>It quickly jumped off and left the campus, crossing the street in front of a police vehicle before going into the yard of a nearby home.</p>
<p>A tranquilizer dart was used on the cougar, which could be seen slowly crawling and writhing around on the home's fenced-in front yard a short time later.</p>

<p>The big cat fell asleep after it was "safely darted," according to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.</p>
<p>It was "safely restrained" in the yard by officers, who were preparing to take it away in a truck, the agency said. The mountain lion would be checked out before being taken back to its habitat.</p>
<p>The agency responded to the incident, along with the Los Angeles Police Department, authorities said.</p>
