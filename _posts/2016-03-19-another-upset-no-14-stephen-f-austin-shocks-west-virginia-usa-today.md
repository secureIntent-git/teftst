Austin Lumberjacks forward Thomas Walkup (0) shoots against West Virginia Mountaineers forward Elijah Macon (45)  in the first half in the first round of the 2016 NCAA Tournament at Barclays Center.</span><meta itemprop="copyrightHolder" content=""/><span class="credit">(Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY Sports)</span></span></p></aside></section></div></div><p>BROOKLYN, N.Y. — West Virginia was beaten at its own game.</p><p>Normally, it's the Mountaineers who force all the turnovers, the Mountaineers who press and pressure opponents until they succumb.</p><p>But on Friday night in the first round of the NCAA tournament, it was the No. 14 seed, Stephen F. Austin, doing all that to knock out the third-seeded Musketeers at Barclays Center. West Virginia is the first No. 3 seed to fall in this year's tournament, losing 70-56.</p><p>West Virginia turned the ball over 22 times — leading to 29 Lumberjacks points — and shot a miserable 30.8% from the field. And head coach Bob Huggins did not pull any punches describing any of it.</p><p>"I don't know why anybody would waste energy pressing us," Huggins said. "We'll throw it to you regardless. That would be a waste of energy really. We're very charitable. We're one of the most charitable groups in college basketball. The second straight game we've turned it over 20 times."</p><p>Mountaineers players admitted they didn't practice well and didn't consider Stephen F. Austin as dangerous as they should have.</p><p>"Their play showed how focused and prepared they were, and we just didn't take it serious," West Virginia forward Devin Williams said. "That's what happens in this tournament when you don't take people serious. They just scouted well and soaked in what the coaching staff was giving."</p><p>Said teammate Esa Ahmad: "Like Dev said, we didn't take it serious, and that's what happens."</p><p>Stephen F. Austin barely shot better than West Virginia did, but it maintained its lead with a combination of its relentless defense, a couple of clutch shots and a strong-second half performance by senior forward Thomas Walkup.</p><p>Walkup scored 25 of his 33 points in the second half (with 19 from the free throw line), leading the Lumberjacks to their second major NCAA tournament upset in three years. In 2014, No. 12 seed Stephen F. Austin — coached then as now by Brad Underwood — upset No. 5 Virginia Commonwealth in overtime.</p><p>Interestingly enough, Underwood also spent one season coaching under Huggins, when he worked at Kansas State. A lot of comparisons had been made all week about both coaches' aggressive defenses, though both insisted they differed significantly. No matter, since the keys were the same: Giving maximum effort, and limiting your own turnovers.</p><p>"Working for Bob Huggins, I know how hard his team practices, and I know how hard they play," Underwood said. "That was our challenge to be better than them in that area. We do that every day. I don't know if there's anyone in the country that works harder than we do and practices harder than we do. We do that every day, and that's all that matters to us."</p><p>The Lumberjacks currently own the longest winning streak in the nation, 21 in a row, including Friday night's game. Next up in Brooklyn on Sunday, they'll face the winner of Notre Dame-Michigan.</p><p>"I think that people realize we're the real deal," Walkup said. "A couple of years ago, when we got an NCAA win, they thought it was almost a fluke. But I think now people are starting to realize that SFA is a really strong basketball program, and (we're) really starting to make a name for ourselves."</p><p><strong>NCAA TOURNAMENT FIRST-ROUND HIGHLIGHTS</strong></p><div id="module-position-O5CI2WajejI" class="story-asset gallery-asset"><div class="galleries embedded_story hasendslate clearfix" data-gallery-id="81914648" data-title="Highlights from the NCAA tournament's first round:Highlights from the NCAA tournament's first round" data-seo-title="highlights-from-the-ncaa-tournaments-first-round" data-ssts="sports/ncaab" data-cst="sports/basketball/college" data-base-page-type="gallery" data-topic="sports,sports_ncaab" data-gal-pageurl="http://www.usatoday.com/picture-gallery/sports/ncaab/2016/03/17/highlights-from-the-ncaa-tournaments-first-round/81914648/"><div class="feature-btns"><p><span class="playbtn feature-btns-label">Autoplay</span></p><p><span class="thumbLabel feature-btns-label">Show Thumbnails</span></p><p><span class="captionLabel feature-btns-label">Show Captions</span></p></div><a class="slide-nav prev gallery-prev" rel="prev">Last Slide</a><a class="slide-nav next gallery-next" rel="next">Next Slide</a></div></div><!-- cxenseparse_end --></div>
