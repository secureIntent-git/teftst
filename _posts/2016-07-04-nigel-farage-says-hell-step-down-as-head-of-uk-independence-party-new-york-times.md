<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="296" data-total-count="1305" id="story-continues-1">His success alarmed lawmakers of the Conservative Party of Prime Minister David Cameron, who, under pressure, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/world/europe/cameron-to-outline-a-recast-european-role-for-britain.html">promised in 2013</a> to call an in-or-out referendum.

Last Tuesday, after the referendum, Mr. Farage taunted fellow lawmakers in Brussels.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="207" data-total-count="1691">“When I came here 17 years ago and said I wanted to lead a campaign to get Britain to leave the European Union, you all laughed at me,” <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36651406">he said to jeers and groans</a>. “Well, you’re not laughing now.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="328" data-total-count="2019">His colleagues in the European Parliament were not sorry to see him go. “<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NigelFarage?src=hash">#NigelFarage</a> is the latest coward to abandon the chaos he is responsible for,” Manfred Weber, a German member of the European Parliament who has denounced Mr. Farage as a demagogue, <a href="https://twitter.com/ManfredWeber/status/749916567413096448">wrote on Twitter</a>. “This shows that he has no credibility at all.”</p><figure id="brexit-infobox-new" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-small"><figcaption class="interactive-caption"/>
