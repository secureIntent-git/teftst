<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="6"><p><span class="articleLocatio&lt;/span&gt;n">Hackers likely caused a Dec. 23 electricity outage in Ukraine by remotely switching breakers to cut power, after installing malware to prevent technicians from detecting the attack, according to a report analyzing how the incident unfolded. </span></p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The report from Washington-based SANS ICS was released late on Saturday, providing the first detailed analysis of what caused a six-hour outage for some 80,000 customers of Western Ukraine's Prykarpattyaoblenergo utility.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>SANS ICS, which advises infrastructure operators on combating cyber attacks, also said the attackers crippled the utility's customer-service center by flooding it with phone calls to prevent customers from alerting the utility that power was down.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"This was a multi-pronged attack against multiple facilities. It was highly coordinated with very professional logistics," said Robert Lee, a former U.S. Air Force cyber warfare operations officer who helped compile the report for SANS ICS. "They sort of blinded them in every way possible."</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Experts widely describe the incident as the first known power outage caused by a cyber attack. Ukraine's SBU state security service blamed Russia, and U.S. cyber firm iSight Partners identified the perpetrator as a Russian hacking group known as "Sandworm."</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Ukraine's energy ministry has said it will hold off on discussing the matter until after Jan. 18, following completion of a formal probe into the matter. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The utility's operators were able to quickly recover by switching to manual operations, essentially disconnecting infected workstations and servers from the grid, according to the report.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>SANS ICS said on its blog it had "high confidence" in its findings, which were based on discussions and analysis from "multiple international community members and companies". (<a href="https://ics.sans.org/blog">ics.sans.org/blog</a>) The report's authors declined to identify those sources. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>U.S. critical infrastructure security expert Joe Weiss said he believed the report's findings would be validated. "They did a phenomenal job," he said.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>There is strong interest in the outage because of concerns that similar techniques could be used to launch more attacks on power operators around the globe. </p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>"What is now true is that a coordinated cyber attack consisting of multiple elements is one of the expected hazards (electric utilities) may face," SANS ICS Director Michael Assante said in a blog.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>"We need to learn and prepare ourselves to detect, respond, and restore from such events in the future," said Assante, former chief security officer of the quasi-governmental North American Electric Reliability Corp.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><p> (Reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston; Editing by <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=james.dalgleish&amp;">James Dalgleish</a>)</p><span id="midArticle_14"/></div>
