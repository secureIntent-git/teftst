	The gunman who slaughtered 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando was a confused, gay man who drank heavily, a man who claims he was his lover for two months <a href="http://www.univision.com/univision-news/united-states/man-who-claims-he-had-sexual-relations-with-orlando-gunman-tells-univision-it-was-revenge-not-terrorism">told Univision</a>.</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	Omar Mateen, the deranged Muslim shooter behind the massacre, held a grudge against Latino men he met at the popular gay club because he felt used by them, the man told the network. “I’ve cried like you have no idea. But the thing that makes me want to tell the truth is that he didn’t do it for terrorism,” the man told Univision Noticias anchor Maria Elena Salinas in an exclusive interview on Tuesday. “In my opinion he did it for revenge.”</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	Mateen even had a tryst with two men, one of whom later revealed he was HIV positive, the man said.</p>                          &#13;
<p>&#13;
	Univision was unable to independently verify the man’s account, but the FBI confirmed to the network that it had met with him.</p>     <p> <a class="ra-related" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/orlando-nightclub-shooting-timeline-revealed-article-1.2680628">Orlando nightclub shooting timeline revealed</a> </p>     &#13;
<p>&#13;
	The man, who did not want his true identity revealed, said he met Mateen last year through a gay dating site and began a relationship soon after.</p>               <!-- HTML Element: 7.2619805 -->                &#13;
<p>&#13;
	He described Mateen as “a very sweet guy” who never showed a violent side. He loved to be cuddled. He was looking for love," he said.</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	Several clubgoers and other acquaintances said that Mateen was a regular at the club and that he was active on such dating sites.</p>                                                                             <div class="ra-module h" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemid="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Pulse-shooter-Omar-Mateen-039did-it-for-revenge039-alleged-ex-lover-New-York-Daily-News.jpg">

	Mateen was married twice and had a child with his second wife.</p>     <p> <a class="ra-related" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/omar-mateen-911-transcripts-show-bomb-threats-terror-pledges-article-1.2680448">Omar Mateen: 911 transcripts show bomb threats, terror pledges</a> </p>     &#13;

	The 29-year-old gunman opened fire with an automatic rifle in Pulse in the early hours of June 12, killing 49 people and wounding dozens more. He was killed in a shootout with police hours later.</p>               <!-- HTML Element: 7.2619806 -->                &#13;
<p>&#13;
	“My reaction was that can’t be the man I know,” the stunned former lover told Univision. “It’s impossible that the man I know could do that.”</p>&#13;
<p>&#13;
	The man said that Mateen was attracted to Latino men, but felt used and rejected by them after several sexual encounters.</p>                                                                             <div class="ra-module h" itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject" itemid="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/1466554878_808_Pulse-shooter-Omar-Mateen-039did-it-for-revenge039-alleged-ex-lover-New-York-Daily-News.jpg">

	Mateen was especially upset after one tryst with a pair of Puerto Rican men, one of whom later revealed he was HIV positive, he added.</p>     <p> <a class="ra-related" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/omar-mateen-visited-pulse-nightclub-hours-mass-shooting-article-1.2682828">Omar Mateen visited Pulse nightclub hours before mass shooting</a> </p>     &#13;

	“He (Omar) was terrified that he was infected,” he said. “I asked him, ‘Did you do a test?’ Yes. He went to the pharmacy and did the test … it came out negative but it doesn’t come out right away. It takes 4, 5 months.</p>               &#13;
<p>&#13;
	“When I asked him what he was going to do now, his answer was, ‘I’m going to make them pay for what they did to me,’” he added.</p>                    <dl id="ra-tags"><dt>Tags:</dt>  <dd> <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/tags/omar-mateen">omar mateen</a> </dd>  <dd> <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/tags/orlando-nightclub-shooting">orlando nightclub shooting</a> </dd>  <dd> <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/tags/lgbt-news">lgbt news</a> </dd>  <dd> <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/tags/hate-crimes">hate crimes</a> </dd>  <dd> <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/tags/fbi">fbi</a> </dd>  <dd> <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/tags/mass-murder">mass murder</a> </dd>  <dd> <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/tags/gun-violence">gun violence</a> </dd>  <dd> <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/tags/hiv-aids">hiv-aids</a> </dd>  </dl><a href="mailto:voicers@nydailynews.com?subject=Pulse shooter Omar Mateen &#x2018;did it for revenge&#x2019;: alleged ex-lover&amp;body=To%20submit%20a%20comment%20about%20this%20article%20for%20publication%20in%20the%20Daily%20News%20Voice%20of%20the%20People%20column,%20please%20include%20your%20name,%20your%20city%20and%20state%20and%20your%20phone%20number.%20(Please%20include%20your%20borough%20or%20neighborhood%20if%20you%20live%20in%20NYC.%20Phone%20number%20is%20for%20verification%20purposes%20only,%20not%20for%20publication.)%20The%20Daily%20News%20reserves%20the%20right%20to%20edit%20letters. %0A%0A http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/pulse-shooter-omar-mateen-revenge-alleged-ex-lover-article-1.2682856" class="ra-editor">Send a Letter to the Editor</a>  <dl id="ra-share-bottom"><dt>Join the Conversation:</dt> <dd class="ra-share-f"> <a target="_blank" href="#">facebook</a> </dd> <dd class="ra-share-t"> <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Pulse shooter Omar Mateen &#x2018;did it for revenge&#x2019;: alleged ex-lover&amp;url=http://nydn.us/28M5TM6">Tweet</a> </dd> </dl></div>
