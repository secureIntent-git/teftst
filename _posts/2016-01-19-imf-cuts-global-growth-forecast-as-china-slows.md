<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">WASHINGTON</span> The International Monetary Fund cut its global growth forecasts for the third time in less than a year on Tuesday, as new figures from Beijing showed that the Chinese economy grew at its slowest rate in a quarter of a century in 2015.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>To back its forecasts, the IMF cited a sharp slowdown in China trade and weak commodity prices that are hammering Brazil and other emerging markets.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The Fund forecast that the world economy would grow at 3.4 percent in 2016 and 3.6 percent in 2017, both years down 0.2 percentage point from the previous estimates made last October. It said policymakers should consider ways to bolster short-term demand.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The updated World Economic Outlook forecasts came as global financial markets have been roiled by worries over China's slowdown -- confirmed by official Chinese data on Tuesday -- and plummeting oil prices.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The IMF maintained its previous China growth forecasts of 6.3 percent in 2016 and 6.0 percent in 2017, which represent sharp slowdowns from 2015.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>China reported that growth for 2015 hit 6.9 percent after a year in which the world's second biggest economy endured huge capital outflows, a slide in the currency and a summer stock market crash.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Shares in Europe and Asia rose and the dollar gained after the China data was released, as investors anticipated greater  efforts by Beijing to spur growth.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Concerns about Beijing's grip on economic policy have shot to the top of global investors' risk list for 2016 after falls in its stock markets and the yuan stoked worries that the economy may be rapidly deteriorating.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>The Fund said a steeper slowing of demand in China remained a risk to global growth and that weaker-than-expected Chinese imports and exports were weighing heavily on other emerging markets and commodity exporters.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"We don't see a big change in the fundamentals in China compared to what we saw six months ago, but the markets are certainly very spooked by small events there that they find hard to interpret," IMF economic counselor Maurice Obstfeld said in a videotaped statement.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>OVERREACTING</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>He said global financial markets seemed to be overreacting to falling oil prices and the risk of a sharp downturn in China.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Obstfeld also said it was critical that China is clear about its overall economic strategy, including its currency.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>"It's not a stretch to suggest that (markets) may be reacting very strongly to rather small bits of evidence in an environment of volatility and risk aversion," Obstfeld said at a news conference. </p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>"The oil price puts stresses on oil exporters ... but there is a silver lining for consumers worldwide, so it's not an unmitigated negative."</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>The IMF report said continued market upheaval could also help drag growth lower if it leads to major risk aversion and currency depreciations in emerging markets. Other risks included further dollar appreciation and an escalation of geopolitical tensions.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>U.S. investment bank Morgan Stanley said the probability of a global recession this year was as high as 20 percent in a worst case scenario.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Soft consumer demand in the United States and Japan and weakness in emerging markets due to worries over plunging oil and commodity prices and capital outflows from China were among the main risks.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>A global recession is loosely defined as growth below the roughly 2.5 percent needed for the world economy to keep up with an expanding population.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The Fund said the outlook for an acceleration of U.S. output was dimming as dollar strength weighs on manufacturing and lower oil prices curtail energy investment. It now projects U.S. economic growth at 2.6 percent for both 2016 and 2017, down 0.2 percentage point in both years from the October forecast.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>In Europe, lower oil prices will help support private consumption, so the IMF said it added 0.1 percentage point to its 2016 euro area growth forecast, bringing it to 1.7 percent, where it will remain for 2017.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Brazil will stay mired in recession in 2016, with output contracting 3.5 percent, a 2.5 percentage-point downward shift  from the previous forecast, and there will be essentially no growth in 2017 as Latin America's largest economy struggles with lower Chinese demand.  </p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Obstfeld said the Fund was encouraging monetary policy to remain expansive in some countries, such as Japan and in Europe.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>"Where there is fiscal space, more infrastructure spending is certainly something that should be on the table," he added.     </p><span id="midArticle_9"/><span id="midArticle_10"/><p> (Reporting By David Lawder; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=giles.elgood&amp;">Giles Elgood</a>)</p><span id="midArticle_11"/></div>
