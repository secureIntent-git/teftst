<br><div id="start-of-content"><p>If you’ve been in San Francisco this week, you’ve probably complained about the traffic caused by the Super Bowl festivities. If you’ve been in Guangzhou instead, you probably think everyone in the Bay Area had better shut up with their complaining, because they don’t know the meaning of pain.</p>
<p>While the US prepares for the big game, China’s preparing for the Lunar New Year, the height of an epic travel season in which many Chinese travel to visit family, racking up about 2.9 billion trips in a 40-day period, <a href="http://bigstory.ap.org/article/957d2e10b61145a0be63429145f7ad6f/china-braces-29-billion-trips-made-during-new-year">according to the AP</a>.</p>
<p>The human migration is already an annual traffic bonanza, but this weekend, several central and eastern provinces were hit with rare, heavy snowfall, closing a major airport in Wuhan and causing major delays on the area’s railroads. <a href="http://www.citylab.com/commute/2016/02/snow-strands-100000-new-year-travelers-in-a-chinese-train-station-year-of-the-monkey/459729/">According to CityLab</a>, that left 100,000 travelers—six digits worth of people—stuck waiting at the Guangzhou train station.</p>
<p>China’s <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-01/31/c_135061983.htm" target="_blank">Xinhua news agency reports</a> that officials in the Jiangsu province shuttered four expressways, hoping to avoid traffic jams like the 1.9-mile mess on the road connecting Jiangxi and Hubei.</p>
<p>The weather’s expected to clear up in the next day or so, and hopefully everyone in the above photos can get where they’re going.</p>
