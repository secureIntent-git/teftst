</div><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="187" data-total-count="3302" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-6">Apple has described this as an unprecedented demand, one that would require the company’s engineers to build a new operating system from scratch and effectively hack into its own phone.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="209" data-total-count="3511" itemprop="articleBody">The Justice Department said that was a significant overstatement. Prosecutors said the technology was no more difficult than passing a new software update to the phone — something the company does regularly.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="178" data-total-count="3689" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-7">Apple executives acknowledged on Friday that it was technically possible but said it was still unwarranted for the government to demand it to create something that did not exist.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="326" data-total-count="4015" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-8">In his 1,100-word letter to his customers early Wednesday, Mr. Cook said what prosecutors were demanding amounted to forcing Apple to create a “back door” to get around its own security protocols, and he vowed a fight. He accused the Justice Department of mounting a “chilling” attack on privacy and Internet security.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="539" data-total-count="4554" itemprop="articleBody">Apple has taken a strong stand on privacy not only because of Mr. Cook’s strong personal beliefs on the issue, but also because the company’s business model encourages a bolder stance. Unlike other Silicon Valley tech giants, Apple’s business has a straightforward hardware model that hinges on selling physical devices like iPhones, iPads and Macs. Other tech companies, including Google, Facebook and Twitter, depend more on the online collection of large amounts of consumer data for their digital advertising-oriented businesses.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="287" data-total-count="4841" itemprop="articleBody">With this week’s dispute generating wide attention on Capitol Hill this week, Republican and Democratic leaders from the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent letters to both Apple and the F.B.I. Friday inviting their executives to testify publicly on the issue at a coming hearing.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="289" data-total-count="5130" itemprop="articleBody">The lawmakers wrote in a joint letter that the pubic debate over encryption and its impact on law enforcement investigations “ has now come to a critical juncture” with this week’s order regarding the iPhone 5c used by Syed Farook in an attack in December that resulted in 14 deaths.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="227" data-total-count="5357" itemprop="articleBody">The Justice Department’s latest filing on Friday also offered new details about the unsuccessful negotiations between Apple and the government to resolve the encryption on their own before the dispute became public this week.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="482" data-total-count="5839" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-9">Among other steps, the two sides discussed options that included using data backed up to the iCloud, other backup computers, separately held toll records or other databases to capture the information held in the cellphone. But for a variety of reasons, the F.B.I concluded, none of those options would work.
