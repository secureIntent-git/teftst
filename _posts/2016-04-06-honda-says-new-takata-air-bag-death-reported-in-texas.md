<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="6"><p><span class="articleLocation">WASHINGTON/DETROIT</span> Honda Motor Co (<span id="symbol_7267.T_0">7267.T</span>) and U.S. regulators said on Wednesday that a 17-year-old driver in Texas was killed last month after a Takata Corp (<span id="symbol_7312.T_1">7312.T</span>) air bag ruptured, marking the tenth U.S. death linked to a defect that has led to the recall of tens of millions of vehicles worldwide.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The latest death took place on March 31 in a recalled 2002 Honda Civic in Fort Bend County, Texas. Honda said the owner had been mailed multiple recall notices but repairs were never made.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The victim was a high school senior who ran into the back of a Honda CR-V while waiting for traffic to clear to make a left turn, said Fort Bend County Sheriff's Deputy Danny Beckwith.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"Everybody should have walked away from this," Beckwith said in an interview. He said shrapnel punctured the air bag and sliced the young woman's neck and carotid artery. She was pronounced dead at the scene.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Overall, 10 people have died in the United States in accidents linked to exploding Takata air bags. Nine of those U.S. deaths have occurred in Honda vehicles, Honda said. Ford Motor Co (<span id="symbol_F.N_2">F.N</span>) has reported a death from a Takata air bag rupture in one of its vehicles in the United States. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>A pregnant woman was killed in Malaysia in July 2014 after the rupture of a Takata air bag in a 2003 Honda City.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, said in a statement the latest death "shows that the current recall efforts are just not getting the job done.  Takata and the automakers have to step up their efforts to locate, notify and fix every impacted car as soon as possible - before anyone else dies."</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a statement on Wednesday it "has demanded that manufacturers work to a 100 percent completion rate, and take all efforts necessary to reach that goal." </p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>"This incident highlights that the conventional approach to recall notification alone is inadequate. NHTSA is renewing its call to all auto manufacturers involved in the Takata air bag recall to intensify and expand their outreach to affected vehicle owners," it said.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>In late December, NHTSA named John Buretta, a former official in the Justice Department's criminal division, to serve as independent monitor overseeing the Takata recalls.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Last month, NHTSA said automakers have replaced more than 7.5 million defective Takata inflators, or about a third of those recalled through December. Honda has replaced about 5.4 million inflators, or 54 percent of vehicles it had recalled through December - the highest completion rate of any automaker.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Takata inflators, which can explode with excessive force and spray metal shrapnel into vehicle passenger compartments, have been linked and more than 100 U.S. injuries. To date, 14 automakers have recalled about 24 million vehicles involving about 28 million Takata air bag inflators.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Honda urged owners to get recall repairs completed quickly. The automaker said it "currently has sufficient supplies of replacement inflators to complete the required repairs under the open recall that affects this vehicle, and we continue to encourage all owners of affected vehicles to seek repair immediately."</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Honda also said it does not have replacement inflators for a driver air bag inflator recall announced in February, but it expects to begin receiving replacement inflators for that recall within a few days.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><span id="midArticle_15"/><p> (Reporting by David Shepardson, editing by G Crosse)</p><span id="midArticle_16"/></div>
