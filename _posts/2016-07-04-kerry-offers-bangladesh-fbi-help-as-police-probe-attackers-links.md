        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"The Secretary (Kerry) encouraged the government of Bangladesh to conduct its investigation in accordance with the highest international standards and offered immediate assistance from U.S. law enforcement, including the FBI," U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Khan told Reuters in an interview that home-grown militants responsible for a wave of killings against individual members of minority groups in the past year and a half were to blame.

        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The gunmen stormed into the restaurant in the diplomatic area late on Friday, before killing at least 20 people once they had separated foreigners from locals.

Two Bangladeshis were also murdered inside the restaurant, while two police officers were killed outside during the 12-hour standoff.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Friday's attack has shocked Bangladesh and analysts have said that as IS loses territory in Iraq and Syria and its finances get drained, it may be trying to build affiliates in other countries like Bangladesh and exploit disaffected youths.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>The Dhaka restaurant attack was the worst since 2005, when JMB set off a series of bombs throughout Bangladesh in the space of an hour. Subsequent suicide attacks on courthouses killed at least 25 people.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><span id="midArticle_11"/><p> (Writing by Tommy Wilkes; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani and Michael Perry)</p><span id="midArticle_12"/></div>
