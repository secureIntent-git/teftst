        <p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="285" data-total-count="285">WASHINGTON — Leaders from more than 50 countries gathered here on Thursday at the behest of <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/o/barack_obama/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Barack Obama" class="meta-per">President Obama</a> to try to reduce the threat from <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/science/topics/atomic_weapons/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about nuclear weapons." class="meta-classifier">nuclear weapons</a>. But the Nuclear Security Summit, the fourth and possibly last of these gatherings, opened with a palpably subdued atmosphere.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="361" data-total-count="646">President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is boycotting the meeting, which makes major breakthroughs on global security unlikely, given his country’s vast nuclear stockpile. And with Mr. Obama — who conceived and championed these meetings — leaving office next year, several experts said it was unlikely that a Nuclear Security Summit would even happen again.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="355" data-total-count="1001">Mr. Obama is expected to celebrate some achievements, including Japan’s commitment to move out 500 kilograms of highly enriched uranium and plutonium, which it is transferring to the United States. But analysts said major security risks remained, not least the large stockpiles of weapons-grade nuclear fuel held in military facilities around the world.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="363" data-total-count="1364">Binding global agreements on nuclear security remain elusive, so the meeting is likely to focus on regional threats. The terrorist attack in Belgium last week has cast a shadow over the gathering, particularly after reports that fighters for the Islamic State were seeking to penetrate a nuclear facility to obtain material for a so-called radioactive dirty bomb.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="412" data-total-count="1776">Mr. Obama has added a session to discuss the status of the military campaign against the Islamic State, in which the administration continues to claim gains. In the afternoon, he will meet with President François Hollande of France; the Islamic State killed more than 125 people in Paris last November. It is Mr. Obama’s only planned one-on-one meeting with a leader, aside from President Xi Jinping of China.</p><div id="story-ad-1" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="261" data-total-count="2037" id="story-continues-1">The president’s refusal to meet individually with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has roiled the diplomatic waters, though the White House on Wednesday did not rule out the possibility that the two men might meet briefly on the margins of the summit.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="372" data-total-count="2409">Mr. Putin’s snub was not unexpected, given the rift between Russia and the United States over Moscow’s military aggression in Syria and Ukraine. But the White House pointed out that Russia has nevertheless cooperated on nuclear issues, not least its role in the multi-party talks with Iran over curbing its <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/iran/nuclear_program/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="Recent and archival news about Iran's nuclear program." class="meta-classifier">nuclear program</a>. (Iran was not invited to attend the summit.)</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="213" data-total-count="2622">Russia is “going to miss out on an opportunity to coordinate with the rest of the international community on these important issues,” Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Wednesday.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="238" data-total-count="2860">“I do think that it serves to further illustrate the degree to which Russia is isolated from the rest of the international community – that for whatever reason, they’ve chosen not to engage in this conversation,” Mr. Earnest said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="446" data-total-count="3306">China, on the other hand, is getting V.I.P. treatment from Mr. Obama. He and Mr. Xi are expected to discuss a range of issues, including climate change and the nuclear threat from North Korea, which has tested a nuclear device and fired ballistic missiles in recent months. North Korea will also be center-stage at a three-way meeting this morning between Mr. Obama, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, and President Park Geun-hye of South Korea.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="267" data-total-count="3573">The Nuclear Security Summit grew out of a landmark speech given by Mr. Obama in Prague in 2009, in which he set a goal of ridding the world of nuclear weapons. Leaders first convened in Washington in 2010, and again in South Korea in 2012 and the Netherlands in 2014.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="276" data-total-count="3849">But when Mr. Obama departs the scene in January, it is not clear who will keep the momentum going. While the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Clinton, supports Mr. Obama’s policies against nuclear proliferation, she has evinced little of his fervor for a nuclear-free world.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="256" data-total-count="4105">Meanwhile, the Republican front-runner, Donald J. Trump, proposed last week that Japan and South Korea build their own nuclear weapons to deter the threat from North Korea – a message that flatly contradicts the nonproliferation agenda of this gathering.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="292" data-total-count="4397">“It’s fair to say that this is an accomplishment of Obama,” Sharon Squassoni, the director of the Proliferation Prevention Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said on Tuesday. But she added, “It may not be the one he sort of ardently wished for the most.”</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#story-continues-2">Continue reading the main story</a>
