<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="6"><p><span class="articleLocation">AMSTERDAM</span> The European Union antitrust chief, who has already charged Google (<span id="symbol_GOOGL.O_0">GOOGL.O</span>) with favoring its own shopping service in internet searches, said on Monday that she was now examining its deals with phone makers and operators.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The comments by European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager follow a year-long investigation into Android, the world's most popular operating system for smartphones, triggered by two complaints.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>A decision on the shopping service could come this year. Like the Android case, it could lead to a fine of up to $7.4 billion or 10 percent of Google's 2015 revenue, and force it to change its business practices.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Vestager said big companies should not try to protect themselves by holding back innovation. </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>"That's why we're looking closely at Google's contracts with phone makers and operators which use the Android operating system," she said at a conference organized by the Dutch competition authority.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>"Our concern is that, by requiring phone makers and operators to pre-load a set of Google apps, rather than letting them decide for themselves which apps to load, Google might have cut off one of the main ways that new apps can reach customers."</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The Commission said last year that it was also investigating whether Google had prevented smartphone and tablet manufacturers from developing and marketing modified and potentially competing versions of Android.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Another area of concern was whether Google had illegally hindered the development and market access of rival applications and services by bundling some of its applications and services distributed on Android devices with other Google products.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><span id="midArticle_9"/><p> (Reporting By Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Kevin Liffey)</p><span id="midArticle_10"/></div>
