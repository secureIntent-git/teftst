<br><div readability="50"><h2>            The Weeknd busts a move (or has one busted around him)        </h2><div class="widget widget-text" data-widget-id="12191" readability="45"><p>LA Times' Mikael Wood and Todd Martens chime in on The Weeknd's Oscar performance. </p><p><b>Mikael Wood: </b><span>So, Todd, the Weeknd just performed “Earned It,” his Oscar-nominated theme from “Fifty Shades of Grey.” What did we think?</span></p><p><b>Todd Martens</b>: <span>I was nervous when I saw an aerialist, but I was into it. I thought he was rather confident. And the acrobatics were sexy.</span></p><p><b>Mikael Wood</b>: <span>Yeah, an aerialist always seems like an overcompensating move. But I agree: He sounded pretty good (or at least better than Sam Smith did). But there was still something of the energy shortage that defined the Weeknd's Grammys performance a few weeks ago.</span></p><p><b>Todd Martens</b>: He's one of the biggest pop stars in the world, yet when it comes to awards shows he's been stuck performing his ballads. But I was OK with the energy level here; the string-streaked song built nicely. I couldn't help but compare it to Smith earlier too. And if you look at those two movie songs, they're both tunes that try to aim for some level of "importance" -- though there's a level of vulnerability in "Earned It," a side you don't always see in the Weeknd.</p><p><b>Mikael Wood</b>: Right. The vulnerability definitely came through, which was nice.  I just wish the Oscars' "importance" (and the Grammys', for that matter) didn't always lead to performers keeping everything tamped down, as though they were afraid to break something.</p><p><b>Todd Martens</b>:<span> That was kind of seductive to me, with the dancers closing in on him, even as he was walking forward. It heightened the claustrophobia inherent in a lot of Weeknd songs.</span></p><p><span>That said, this performance was about all of "50 Shades" I can take.</span></p></div></div>
