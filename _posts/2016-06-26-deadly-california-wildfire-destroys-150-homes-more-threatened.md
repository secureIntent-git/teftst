We are going to be committed to this for some time," Captain Tyler Townsend of the Kern County Fire Department told CNN. "A lot of communities are still in danger."</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Crews were working in steep, rugged terrain, fighting flames that were fueled by hot, dry weather and brush, grass and chaparral left bone dry by California's devastating five-year drought.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Officials have not identified the two people killed in the huge conflagration, one of the worst in an already intense fire season in California.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The Los Angeles Times reported that investigators had found what they believed to be the remains of a third victim at a mobile home in the community of South Lake.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>"We are treating it like a crime scene.

        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>On Friday, authorities warned the more than 3,000 residents of the community of Lake Isabella on the shore of a reservoir to be prepared to evacuate.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Southeast of Lake Isabella, dozens of burned-out homes and car frames were left behind in a neighborhood reduced to a field of mangled metal and collapsed roofs. </p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>To the south, firefighters were struggling to manage the so-called San Gabriel Complex fire in the foothills of Los Angeles County. There were two fires that started on Friday and cover a combined 5,285 acres, fire officials said.
