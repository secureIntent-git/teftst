                    <p> At least nine people were killed and scores injured after two commuter trains collided at high speed in southern Germany early Tuesday, officials said. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> A massive rescue operation — involving more than 500 personnel and some 14 helicopters — was launched following the crash near the town of Bad Aibling in Bavaria at around 7 a.m. local time (1 a.m. ET). </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> German officials told a press conference two passengers were still missing more than six hours after the incident. They said there were around 150 people on both trains — the same number police earlier said had been injured. </p>
                
              
              
              
                
              
              
              
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                    
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
                
              
                    
              
              
                    <p> The trains were traveling around a curve at around 60 mph on a single-track route when they collided, German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt told reporters. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> "One train more or less plowed into the other," he said, adding that the curve meant it was unlikely the train drivers saw each other. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> He said the railway was equipped with a safety mechanism that should have forced the trains to automatically brake, but that it was too soon to say "what kind of effect it had in this case" and that crews were still attempting to recover the trains' black boxes. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> "I just visited the crash site and it is a scary picture," Dobrindt said. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Police spokesman Markus Wessner earlier told NBC News that at least one of the trains derailed in the incident between Rosenheim and Bad Aibling. </p>

                    <p> The local blood donation center based in Munich, around 30 miles away, issued a statement urging people to give blood after the "tragic train accident … increased the need of life saving blood donations." </p>
