<p>&#13;
	"My heart hurts hearing this news.. So terrible. Praying for Christina and her family," Nick Jonas posted on Twitter.</p>      &#13;

	Before You Exit did not comment on her final moments, but said that "Words fail to describe how much Christina means to all of us. She was always a constant beam of light and energy into the hearts of everyone around her."</p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
	"I know you're spinning in Heaven love," band member Riley McDonough tweeted.</p>    &#13;
<p>&#13;
