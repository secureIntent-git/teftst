<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">SAN FRANCISCO</span> The U.S. Navy included 14 Boeing Co F/A-18E/F Super Hornets valued at $1.5 billion and two Lockheed Martin Corp F-35C jets worth $270 million on a list of "unfunded priorities" that it prepared for Congress, according to U.S. defense officials.  </p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The list, which often lays the groundwork for Congress to add funding to the official Pentagon budget request, also includes $433 million in the final third tranche of funding for a DDG-51 destroyer, said one of the sources.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The ship will be built by Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc and General Dynamics Corp.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Navy Secretary Ray Mabus first disclosed the addition of the 14 Boeing jets to the Navy's wish list for fiscal year 2017 during a hearing of the House Appropriations defense subcommittee on Tuesday, but did not include the associated funding level. </p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Mabus said the additional jets would be needed to maintain the Boeing production line if a big foreign order was not finalized. He did not mention the buying country.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>The Navy had requested two F/A-18 jets in its FY 2017 budget, and said it planned to buy a larger number of jets in FY 2018 with a foreign order expected to fill the gap in 2017. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Sources close to Boeing have said the company will need to invest several hundred million dollars to buy materials to start production of 28 F/A-18 fighters for Kuwait, a deal that was initially expected to be finalized last year but has stalled in the U.S. government approval process.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>The Navy needs more Super Hornets since it is using its older model F/A-18 fighters more heavily than expected in the fight against Islamic State, and because the maintenance required on those jets is taking longer than expected.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>The Navy had planned to replace the older model F/A-18C/D model jets with F-35s, but that program is running behind its original schedule. The Navy is not expected to start using its first F-35C model jets, which take off and land on aircraft carriers, until late 2018 or early 2019. </p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>No comment was immediately available from the companies involved.        </p><span id="midArticle_10"/><span id="midArticle_11"/><p> (Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)</p><span id="midArticle_12"/></div>
