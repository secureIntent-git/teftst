<br><div id=""><p>Google has already <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2015/10/update-response-refugee-migrants.html" target="_blank">raised $11 million</a> to fund refugee relief efforts in Europe, but there’s more where that came from.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Today, the tech giant <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2016/01/refugees-education-chromebooks.html" target="_blank">announced</a> it’s donating $5.3 million to give refugees in Germany access to Chromebooks. Google.org, the search giant’s philanthropic arm, is teaming up with a non-profit called NetHope on the initiative, <a href="http://reconnect.nethope.org/project-reconnect-english" target="_blank">Project Reconnect</a>. NetHope will use the grant to buy 25,000 Chromebooks equipped with education and language learning apps, which they will dole out to non-profits that are working with refugees in Germany.</p>

	'I want Google to help the non-profit community think about this stuff in a more Google-y type of way.'	<span class="attribution">Brian Reich, Director, Innovation Lab, UN High Commissioner for Refugees</span>
</p>

<p>The goal, according to Jacquelline Fuller, director of Google.org, is to ensure refugees not only have the necessities they need to survive but the tools they need to continue on with their normal lives. “As they make it through a dangerous journey, the first thing refugees need is to find shelter, food and access to care,” Fuller <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2016/01/refugees-education-chromebooks.html" target="_blank">wrote</a> in a blog post. “But soon enough, they have to learn the local language, acquire skills to work in a new country, and figure out a way to continue their studies—all in an effort to reclaim and reconnect with the lives they had before.”</p>
<p>Still, even 25,000 Chromebooks is a tiny number compared to the roughly <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/08/germany-on-course-to-accept-one-million-refugees-in-2015" target="_blank">one million asylum seekers</a> Germany registered in 2015. That’s why, instead of providing Chromebooks to individuals, Project Reconnect is working with non-profits, which can use the devices to build Internet cafes and organize educational events for children. As part of this partnership, Deutsche Telekom is giving the grant recipients a discount on broadband access, which is critical, given the fact that Chromebooks need to be connected to the Internet to run most apps.</p>
<p>For now, Project Reconnect will only operate in Germany, but according to Frank Schott, NetHope’s managing director of global programs, “if we’re successful, Google said there’s the potential for more.”</p>
<h3>The Multiplying Effect</h3>
<p>Proving this donation can make a difference at scale is crucial, says Brian Reich, director of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees’ innovation lab, The Hive. While Reich applauds Google’s financial generosity, he says that to solve a problem as gigantic as the refugee crisis is, we need to focus less on the size of individual donations and more on whether those donations will have a multiplying effect, meaning they benefit people other than just the direct beneficiaries.</p>
<p>“A lot of Chromebooks will get into the hands of people who will benefit greatly from them,” Reich says. “The question is: does that also benefit other people who are not those who receive the Chromebooks?”</p>
<p>The answer may be yes, but Reich says it will take careful analysis—the type Google excels at in its for-profit work—to determine whether the donation had a Google-sized impact. “I want Google to help the non-profit community think about this stuff in a more Google-y type of way,” he says. “I want everyone else to benefit from the intelligence that Google put in—their process, their thinking, their data.”</p>
<p><sup>1.</sup> Update 1/25/16 5:16 PM EST An earlier version of this story mistakenly reported that Google had already donated $10 million. The earlier donation was $11 million.</p>
