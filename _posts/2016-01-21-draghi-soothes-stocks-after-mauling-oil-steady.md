<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="6"><p><span class="articleLocation">LONDON</span> A bounce in European shares, a tentative stabilization in oil and soothing sounds from ECB head Mario Draghi helped steady global markets on Thursday, after a torrid few days that has wiped trillions of dollars off asset values. </p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>A 3-percent slump in Chinese stocks had given Asia another bruising, so there was relief as a more than 1 percent jump for London's FTSE, Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 as Draghi hinted at more rate cuts, pulled markets out of their nosedive. </p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Draghi said the dramatic slump in oil and stocks prices this month had compounded the risks to the euro zone economy and that it would "review" its already record low interest rates and 1.5 trillion euro money printing program at its March meeting.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"In this (volatile market) environment, euro area inflation dynamics also continue to be weaker than expected," Draghi said. </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>"It will therefore be necessary to review and possibly reconsider our monetary policy stance at our next meeting in early March when the new staff macroeconomic projections become available."</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>As nerves settled, U.S. futures prices flicked from red to green and Wall Street main S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial opened roughly 0.6 percent higher as traders brushed off a jump in unemployment benefit claims. [.N]</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>There was also relief that oil prices, which are down more than 25 percent since the start of the year and one of the main drivers of the cross-asset rout, were also steadier at $27.70 for Brent and $28.20 for U.S. benchmark WTI.[O/R]</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Draghi's comments cut the euro to below $1.08 for the first time in two weeks and to a 9-month low against Japan's yen which has been boosted in recent weeks by its reputation as a safe refuge in times of market turmoil.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Euro zone bonds rose too. German Bund yields, which move inverse to prices, fell to their lowest since May last year as the recent strains on Portuguese, Italian and Spanish bonds also eased. </p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>"Draghi is painting the picture you would expect," said National Australia Bank strategist Gavin Friend said. "He is opening the door to further policy easing if the conditions require."</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><span id="midArticle_11"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>SUBMERGING MARKETS</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>In emerging markets the tensions remained intense, however. MSCI's 23-country EM index notched a 6-1/2 year low and Russia's rouble tanked almost 5 percent at one point as it set a record low against the dollar for a second day running.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>The Kremlin called the rouble moves "volatile" but said it was "not collapsing". A spokesman said President Vladimir Putin had no special meetings on the situation planned, though he was being kept regularly updated on the market moves.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Chinese stocks, which in tandem with oil have been the major trigger behind the global rout, ended down 3 percent after another volatile session there. </p><span id="midArticle_15"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>That in turn sent MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific excluding Japan to a new four-year low. Japan's Nikkei ended down 2.4 percent too, adding to its 3.7 percent plunge in the previous session. </p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>Shanghai-based investor director at Nanhai Fund Management Co, David Dai, said fears of a prolonged bear market were, nevertheless, overdone.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>"With stocks having fallen so much, much of the risk has been priced in and another free-fall is quite unlikely, although the chance of a sustainable rebound is slim," he said.    </p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>In the foreign exchange markets, the swoon in the euro sent the dollar index, which tracks the U.S. unit against six of the world's other biggest currencies, up 0.5 percent.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The dollar also clawed back to 117.16 yen after hitting 115.97 on Wednesday having been undermined by U.S. data.     </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><span id="midArticle_5"/><p> (Additional reporting by Lisa Twaronite in Tokyo; Editing by <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=ralph.boulton&amp;">Ralph Boulton</a>)</p><span id="midArticle_6"/></div>
