Yet he has also raised the possibility that Turkey would reinstate the death penalty, which it had abolished as a part of its pursuit to join the European Union.</p><figure class="promo media video embedded layout-large-horizontal " data-videoid="100000004534962" data-media-action="modal" data-autoplay="false" data-embedded="false" data-adsensitivity="" data-live="false" aria-label="media" role="group"><span class="visually-hidden">Video</span>

So let us think before taking each step. We will act with reason and experience.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="445" data-total-count="5303">Nigar Goksel, a senior Turkey analyst for the International Crisis Group, said there were two possible directions. “Either Erdogan utilizes this incident to redesign institutions in Ankara to his own benefit,” she said, “or he takes the opportunity with the solidarity that was extended to him by the opposition and different segments of society to reciprocate by investing more genuinely in rule of law and legitimate forms of dissent.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="275" data-total-count="5578">Mr. Erdogan’s history suggests the latter possibility is unlikely. Each time he has faced a challenge to his power, from street protests three years ago to a corruption investigation that went after his inner circle, he has sidelined his enemies and become more autocratic.</p><div id="story-ad-3" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

Alongside the military, the government also dismissed thousands of judges, who seemingly had no role to play in a military revolt.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="236" data-total-count="6157">“Now the government has a free hand to design the bureaucracy as they like, and they will,” Mr. Unluhisarcikli said. “All in all, Turkey will become a country where power is more consolidated and dissent will be more difficult.”</p><figure id="THEurope-newsletter-module" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-small"><figcaption class="interactive-caption"/>
    
    
</figure><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="442" data-total-count="6599">As the purge of the military continued on Sunday, one of those arrested was Gen. Bekir Ercan Van, the chief of Incirlik Air Base, from which the United States military flies missions over Iraq and Syria against the Islamic State. Over the weekend, General Van approached American officials seeking asylum but was refused, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who spoke anonymously because of the sensitive nature of the subject.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="270" data-total-count="6869">The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, told Mr. Erdogan that the government would swiftly examine asylum claims by eight Turkish officers who fled to northern Greece in a helicopter and were detained on charges of illegal entry. Turkey has demanded their extradition.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="400" data-total-count="7269">As the drama of the coup attempt played out Friday and into Saturday morning, it looked for a moment as if Mr. Erdogan was on the verge of being toppled from power. The president spoke to the nation via the FaceTime app on his iPhone after he narrowly escaped being captured by mutinous soldiers, who arrived in a helicopter at a seaside hotel where he was vacationing — just after he had departed.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="184" data-total-count="7453">Then, around 3:30 a.m., he landed in Istanbul, after a dangerous flight undertaken while the plotters still had fighter jets in the air — the surest sign that the revolt was failing.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="169" data-total-count="7622">But more than his dramatic arrival at the Istanbul airport, his confident speech on Saturday on top of the bus seemed to emphatically declare that he was back in charge.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="114" data-total-count="7736">Celebrations by his supporters continued on Sunday, with jubilant crowds marching through the streets of Istanbul.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="173" data-total-count="7909">“Look around you,” one of the supporters, Eytan Karatas, 37, a mechanic, said. “Look at these people. We are the real soldiers of this country, and we have a chief.”</p><a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#whats-next">Continue reading the main story</a>
