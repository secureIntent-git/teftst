                    <p> A truck plowed into pedestrians during Bastille Day celebrations in the popular French seaside city of Nice Thursday, leaving at least 80 people dead in what the nation's president called "obviously a terrorist attack." </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> The deadly toll, which included several children, came after the truck slammed into revelers gathered on a promenade to watch fireworks, French President Francois Hollande said in an address Friday morning. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> "Such a monstrosity," Hollande said. He pledged to step up efforts to fight terror in Iraq and Syria, and extended a state of emergency for three months. </p>
                
              
                    
              
              
                    <p> "France is deeply saddened, but it is also very strong," Hollande said. "I can assure you we will always be stronger than the fanatics who are trying to attack us." </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> The driver was killed by police, Hollande said. It is unknown if anyone else was involved, he said. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> The truck struck the crowd at around 10:40 p.m. local time (4:40 p.m. ET) shortly after a fireworks display, officials and witnesses said. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> Christian Estrosi, president of the Provence-Alpes-CÃ´te-d'Azur region that includes Nice, told French media that the driver also shot at people. A senior U.S. military official told NBC News that guns and explosives were found in the truck. </p>

                    <p> Eyewitness Andrew Botros described the scene as a "white truck literally racing through crowds of all ages." </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> At the time of Hollande's address, 77 people were confirmed dead. A short time later, French Minister of Interior Bernard Cazeneuve said the death toll had risen to 80, and 18 others were in critical condition. </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> U.S. President Barack Obama earlier condemned what he called "what appears to be a horrific terrorist attack" and said the U.S. has offered any assistance France may need. "We stand in solidarity and partnership with France, our oldest ally, as they respond to and recover from this attack." </p>

                    <p> "I looked up and saw, like, a tsunami wave of people just running towards me as fast as they possibly could screaming at the top of their lungs," Dr. Kevin Motamedi, a Denver physician on a tour of Europe, told NBC News. "And I just grabbed who I was with and started running as fast as possible. It was basically just complete mass hysteria." </p>
                
              
              
              
                    <p> "It was the scariest moment of my life, easily," Motamedi said. "As we were running, you could tell the people in front of us had no idea that anything was going on, so we were running and grabbing people saying, 'Run. Go home!'" </p>
