<br><div id="start-of-content"><article class="content link-underline relative body-copy" data-js="content" itemprop="articleBody" readability="57.900795755968"><p>As Team Culture settled in on Sunday night to liveblog the Oscars, we had our worries. Would Chris Rock’s jokes land? Would <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> walk away empty-handed? Would the winners be so white we were blinded where we sat? There were a lot of great unknowns.</p>



<p>As it turned out, we needn’t have worried. A few minor blunders aside (Sam Smith: what, what, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/01/arts/sam-smith-the-only-openly-gay-oscar-winner-not-really.html?_r=0" target="_blank">what were you thinking?</a>), the night was a rousing success. Rock was funny; Lady Gaga belted out some vocal kerosene and <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2016/02/29/lady_gaga_s_oscar_performance_of_til_it_happens_to_you_was_both_awkward.html" target="_blank">lit a musical match</a>; and—holy crap—Leonardo DiCaprio finally won his own little gold man. (And, more importantly to <em>Ex Machina</em> fans, so did Alicia Vikander.) Yes, friends, it was a good year to watch the Oscars.</p>
<p>The Academy Awards telecast, however, isn’t the only thing on our minds on this week’s episode of <em>The Monitor</em>. We’ve also got a lot of dirt to dish (wait, that doesn’t quite sound right…) on the forthcoming Lonely Island movie, the subpar performance of <em>Gods of Egypt</em>, and the <a href="http://www.ew.com/article/2016/02/29/dark-tower-rises-stephen-king-idris-elba-and-matthew-mcconaughey" target="_blank">casting of Idris Elba</a> in an adaptation of Stephen King’s <em>The Dark Tower</em>.</p>
<p>So, go ahead and reheat the last bit of Oscars night leftovers you have and pop in those earbuds. Editors and writers <a href="http://www.wired.com/author/peterrubin/" target="_blank">Peter Rubin</a>, <a href="http://www.wired.com/author/awatercutter/" target="_blank">Angela Watercutter</a>, and <a href="http://www.wired.com/author/kevin-mcfarland/" target="_blank">K.M. McFarland</a> are here and we have a few things about the Academy Awards that we left unsaid. Hear us talk about all of them now.</p>
