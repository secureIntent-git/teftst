<br><div id="start-of-content"><p>What’s that Harley Quinn line? Something about hoping you have insurance? Regardless, it’s time to buckle up, call your State Farm agent, and hope for the best, because the first real trailer for David Ayer’s <em>Suicide Squad</em> movie is here and it’s freaking bonkers. Unlike the leaked, <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/07/comic-con-suicide-squad/" target="_blank">then officially released</a>, sizzle reel that debuted at last year’s Comic-Con International, this clip is a full-blown ride to hell. Quinn (Margot Robbie), Deadshot (Will Smith), Enchantress (Cara Delevingne), Joker (Jared Leto), Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), Rick Flagg (Joel Kinnaman), El Diablo (Jay Hernandez), Slipknot (Adam Beach), Katana (Karen Fukuhara), Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnouye-Agbaje), Amanda Waller (Viola Davis)—the posse is here and in full effect. Check out the new trailer above.<br/><strong>Essential Quote:</strong> “We’re bad guys, it’s what we do.” — Harley Quinn (Robbie)<br/><strong>Song:</strong> Queen, “Bohemian Rhapsody” </p>
