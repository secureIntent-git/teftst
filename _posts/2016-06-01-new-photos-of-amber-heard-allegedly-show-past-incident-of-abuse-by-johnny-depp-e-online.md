News the "alleged victim" <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/768537/inside-johnny-depp-and-amber-heard-s-shockingly-ugly-divorce-everything-we-know" target="_blank">decided not to</a> file a report and police concluded no crime had occurred and left.</p><p>At the time of Heard's divorce filing on May 23, Depp's rep told E! News <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/768263/johnny-depp-breaks-silence-after-amber-heard-files-for-divorce" target="_blank">in a statement</a>, "Given the brevity of this marriage and the most recent and tragic loss of his mother, Johnny will not respond to any of the salacious false stories, gossip, misinformation and lies about his personal life. Hopefully the dissolution of this short marriage will be resolved quickly." We have reached out to Depp's team for additional comment in light of these most recent allegations. </p><p><strong>For more information on domestic abuse or to get help for yourself or someone you love, visit the website for <a href="http://www.thehotline.org/" target="_blank">The National Domestic Violence Hotline</a> or call 1-800-799-7233.</strong></p></section></div>
