									<span class="marg-r-micro link-underline-micro">This photo show a T-Tauri star named CVSO 30, located approximately 1200 light-years away from Earth. In 2012, astronomers found an exoplanet (CVSO 30b), orbiting the star very close and quickly at a mere 11 hours. Recently, astronomers found a second planet (CVSO 30c, located uppper left) orbiting at a snail’s pace --- taking 27,000 years to complete a rotation. Astronomers are still exploring how such an exotic system came to form in such a short timeframe, as the star is only 2.5 million years old. It’s possible the two planets interacted at some point in the past, scattering off one another and settling in their current extreme orbits.</span><span class="credit link-underline-sm"><span aria-hidden="true" role="presentation" class="ui ui-photo inline-block ui-credit relative opacity-6 marg-l-sm "/><a href="https://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1624a/"> ESO/Schmidt et al.</a></span>								</p>
