        <p>It was frigid. It was brutal and ugly. It was a slug-it-out, defensive, grind-it-out kind of game.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/page/SEA/seattle-seahawks">Seahawks</a>-<a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/page/MIN/minnesota-vikings">Vikings</a> opening round playoff game Saturday wasn't ordinary. Yet the Seahawks, beaten to a <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25444729/look-seahawks-punter-has-bloody-face-after-faceplanting-vs-vikings">bloody, frozen pulp</a> for three quarters, won in vintage Seahawks fashion, rallying from a two-score, fourth-quarter hole to stun the Vikings and those who braved the negative temperatures at TCF Bank Stadium. The sixth-seeded Seahawks left Minnesota with a 10-9 win, advancing to the divisional round of the playoffs where they'll face the 15-1 <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/page/CAR/carolina-panthers">Panthers</a> next weekend.</p><p>In <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25444785/the-vikings-seahawks-playoff-weather-was-so-cold-it-set-a-record">the third-coldest game on record</a>, the Vikings defense manhandled the Seahawks in the trenches, pounding <a class="playerLink" href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/playerpage/1272242/russell-wilson">Russell Wilson</a> for all fourth quarters. Capitalizing on costly Seahawks mistakes and utilizing the then-reliable right foot of Walsh, the Vikings slowly built a 9-0 lead entering the fourth quarter.</p><p>But the Seahawks rallied in the negative-degree weather, taking a 10-9 lead thanks to a crazy ad-libbed play from Wilson, which led to a <a class="playerLink" href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/playerpage/1244486/doug-baldwin">Doug Baldwin</a> touchdown, and a costly <a class="playerLink" href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/playerpage/517568/adrian-peterson">Adrian Peterson</a> fumble, which the Seahawks converted into the winning points. From there, the Seahawks' defense turned up the heat and relied on some last-second luck. </p><p>Let's break it all down.</p><p><figure><img src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Seahawks-stun-Vikings-with-fourth-quarter-rally-6-things-to-know-CBSSportscom.jpg" height="400" width="640"/><figcaption>The Seahawks celebrate their stunning win. <span>(USATSI)</span></figcaption></figure></p><p><strong>1. Seattle's fourth-quarter magic</strong></p><p>When Walsh nailed his third field goal of the game, giving the Vikings a nine-point lead in the third quarter, the Vikings appeared to be on their way to a controlling win. And then Russell Wilson happened.</p><p>Driving into Vikings territory in the fourth quarter, Wilson came up with a season-saving play when a shotgun snap flew past him and onto the other side of the 50-yard line. Wilson slid to his knees and recovered the fumble at his own 45-yard line. In typical Wilson fashion, he somehow escaped an onslaught of defenders and found <a class="playerLink" href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/playerpage/1860834/tyler-lockett">Tyler Lockett</a> down the field.</p><p>Wilson turned a potential back-breaking negative play into a huge gain, giving Seattle an extra breath.</p><center readability="1.1497005988024"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" readability="4.5988023952096"><p>Only Russell Wilson could take a botched snap and sure-fire 20-yard loss..

With a chance to pad their lead and ice the game, the Vikings turned to Peterson. But Peterson couldn't hang onto the ball.</p><p><a class="playerLink" href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/playerpage/1130628/kam-chancellor">Kam Chancellor</a> stripped Peterson and gave the Seahawks a chance to steal the game.</p><center readability="0.4672131147541"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" readability="2.3360655737705"><p>Kam Chancellor is too strong: <a href="https://t.co/KMBYt3psnr">https://t.co/KMBYt3psnr</a> <a href="https://t.co/em80lMKbTY">pic.twitter.com/em80lMKbTY</a></p>— SB Nation (@SBNation) <a href="https://twitter.com/SBNation/status/686284345582219264">January 10, 2016</a></blockquote></center><center readability="0.64102564102564"><blockquote class="twitter-video" lang="en" readability="3.2051282051282"><p>Adrian Peterson on the sideline after the fumble. <a href="https://t.co/9T5iynN28o">pic.twitter.com/9T5iynN28o</a></p>— MarcusD (@_MarcusD_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_MarcusD_/status/686285424650809344">January 10, 2016</a></blockquote></center><p>The Seahawks didn't waste the opportunity, kicking a field goal to earn a one-point advantage. The two teams traded punts twice before the Vikings' fateful drive. Starting at their own 39-yard line with 1:42 showing on the game clock, the Vikings made their way down the field thanks to a pass interference penalty and shoddy tackling, which allowed <a class="playerLink" href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/playerpage/1633122/kyle-rudolph">Kyle Rudolph</a> to pick up 24 yards on a short pass. </p><p>The Vikings, situated at the 18-yard line, milked the clock and inched closer to the end zone, eventually settling for a chip-shot from the Seahawks' 9-yard line. With 26 seconds left, Walsh -- perfect on his first three kicks -- stepped up to send the Vikings to the next round. </p><p>Instead, he shanked it. Walsh, who overcame some poor holds on his previous kicks, couldn't handle another subpar hold, pulling the kick way wide, sealing the Seahawks' win.</p><p><figure><img src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Seahawks-stun-Vikings-with-fourth-quarter-rally-6-things-to-know-CBSSportscom.png" height="400" width="640"/><figcaption>The laces were facing Walsh on the game-deciding kick. <span>(NBC/NFL)</span></figcaption></figure></p><p>But Vikings head coach Mike Zimmer didn't let Walsh, <a href="https://twitter.com/SeifertESPN/status/686298616579817472">who was reportedly sobbing after the game</a>, off the hook.</p><p>"It's a chip shot," Zimmer said, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/AroundTheNFL/status/686298182167347200">Around the NFL</a>.

Defense wins</strong></p><p>The missed kick and the drama of the final few minutes will overshadow every other storyline, but this game belonged to both defenses. </p><p>Entering the game, one of the key matchups figured to be Minnesota's run game vs. Seattle's run defense. Adrian Peterson won the regular season rushing title with 1,485 yards or 92.8 yards per game. The Seahawks allowed just 81.5 rushing yards per game -- the best mark in the league.</p><p>On Sunday, Peterson was limited to just 45 yards on 23 carries. As a whole, the Vikings' offense racked up 183 yards for an average of 3.3 yards per play. The Seahawks' offense didn't fare much better, going for 226 yards for an average of 4.0 yards per play. </p><p>Though the Vikings' defense held Seattle in check, they failed to come up with game-changing plays (see: Wilson's botched-snap pass above). The Seahawks' defense, on the other hand, didn't let the Vikings into the end zone. </p><p>In the first half, Seahawks safety <a class="playerLink" href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/playerpage/1245247/earl-thomas">Earl Thomas</a> prevented a touchdown, demonstrating his incredible range by jarring the ball loose on a deep ball intended for a seemingly open Jared McKinnon.</p><center readability="0.32624113475177"><blockquote class="twitter-video" lang="en" readability="1.6312056737589"><p>BOOM <a href="https://twitter.com/Earl_Thomas">@Earl_Thomas</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gohawks?src=hash">#gohawks</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SEAvsMIN?src=hash">#SEAvsMIN</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SeahawksNation?src=hash">#SeahawksNation</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/seahawks?src=hash">#seahawks</a> <a href="https://t.co/tRDpsz0gR8">pic.twitter.com/tRDpsz0gR8</a></p>— Baby the Yorkie (@dababyyorkie) <a href="https://twitter.com/dababyyorkie/status/686261115957870592">January 10, 2016</a></blockquote></center><p>In fact, all nine of the Vikings' points were only scored due to Seattle's sloppiness, which brings us to ... </p><p><strong>3. Seattle overcomes critical mistakes</strong></p><p>On the Seahawks' first drive, they failed to pick up a first down. On fourth down, a low snap forced punter <a class="playerLink" href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/playerpage/1102791/jon-ryan">Jon Ryan</a> to abandon his punt. Ryan opted to run (and eventually hurdle) for the first down instead. Ryan got stopped short of the line to gain, and the Vikings were in business.</p><p>It definitely looked like Ryan still could have gotten the punt away. As the lone Vikings defender who flashed in front of Ryan was stumbling to the turf.</p><center readability="1.003937007874"><blockquote class="twitter-video" lang="en" readability="4.0157480314961"><p>Jon Ryan grabs the low snap and takes off, tries to hurdle. <a href="https://t.co/gaCSjXUjOd">pic.twitter.com/gaCSjXUjOd</a></p>— MarcusD (@_MarcusD_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_MarcusD_/status/686252557295984640">January 10, 2016</a></blockquote></center><p>The Vikings cashed in with three points.</p><p>Then, the Seahawks ran out of timeouts with 12:41 remaining in the first half, wasting one timeout on defense before a Minnesota punt and burning two due to play-clock issues.</p><p>With under six minutes remaining in the first half, the Seahawks were seemingly in field goal range and were set to tie the game. But a delay of game penalty on third down backed the Seahawks to the 33-yard line. After a short pass on the ensuing play, the Seahawks decided to go for it on fourth down instead of attempting a field goal from the 30-yard line.</p><p>Given the weather conditions, that decision made sense. But the Seahawks' play call didn't make any sense. On fourth-and-13, Wilson threw a pass way short of the sticks, picking up just 7 yards. If they were going to throw short, why didn't they just punt to maximize field position? And if they were going to go for it, why didn't they take a deep shot? An interception wouldn't have hurt the Seahawks in that situation and it would've given them a chance to score a touchdown or pick up a first down via a defensive penalty.</p><p>To close out the half, the Seahawks had a chance to take a 7-3 lead. On third down from the Vikings' 38-yard line, Baldwin slipped past the Vikings' defense near the goal line.</p><p><figure><img src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/1452466109_250_Seahawks-stun-Vikings-with-fourth-quarter-rally-6-things-to-know-CBSSportscom.jpg" height="400" width="640"/><figcaption>Doug Baldwin was open for a walk-in touchdown. <span>(NBC/NFL)</span></figcaption></figure></p><p>With an accurate and on-time throw, Baldwin would've scored with ease. Instead, Wilson's throw resembled a shanked punt. The hang time allowed the Vikings' defenders to recover and break up the play. Seattle entered halftime with no points.</p><p>Things didn't get better after the break. To open up the third quarter, the Seahawks burned their first timeout on their opening drive. On fourth-and-3 near the Vikings' 45-yard line -- with the Vikings clearly confused -- the Seahawks were too slow getting to the line of scrimmage. They took a timeout with the play clock at zero.</p><p>Wilson threw a pick to <a class="playerLink" href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/playerpage/1868411/trae-waynes">Trae Waynes</a> on the next play.</p><center readability="0.63157894736842"><blockquote class="twitter-video" lang="en" readability="3.1578947368421"><p>Russell Wilson intercepted off the tipped pass <a href="https://t.co/gPw2WG9GjH">pic.twitter.com/gPw2WG9GjH</a></p>— MarcusD (@_MarcusD_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_MarcusD_/status/686273184551858177">January 10, 2016</a></blockquote></center><p>On the ensuing drive, a dumb roughing the passer penalty on <a class="playerLink" href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/playerpage/519918/cliff-avril">Cliff Avril</a> moved the ball deep into Seahawks' territory.

You could argue all nine could've/should've been prevented.</p><p><strong>4. Not much changed a month later</strong></p><p>On Dec. 6, the Seahawks waltzed into Minnesota and whooped the Vikings, 38-7. In that game, Bridgewater completed 17 of his 28 passes for just 118 yards, no touchdowns, and a pick. He recorded just 4.2 yards per attempt -- a season low. Peterson received just eight carries and picked up 18 yards.</p><p>This was his longest run of that game:</p><center><img src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Seahawks-stun-Vikings-with-fourth-quarter-rally-6-things-to-know-CBSSportscom.gif" height="250" width="450"/></center><p>The Seahawks defense arguably had their best defensive performance of the season on that December day, which means even the <a class="playerLink" href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/players/playerpage/1246081/jimmy-clausen">Jimmy Clausen</a>-led <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/teams/page/CHI/chicago-bears">Bears</a> <a href="http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25319383/this-is-what-happens-when-the-bears-go-full-jimmy-clausen">had a better day</a> than the Vikings.</p><center readability="1.7317708333333"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en" readability="5.5416666666667"><p>In the 1st meeting, the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Seahawks?src=hash">#Seahawks</a> held the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Vikings?src=hash">#Vikings</a> to 9 yds per drive, their most dominant performance of the year <a href="https://t.co/P8PwDD8gRO">pic.twitter.com/P8PwDD8gRO</a></p>— ProFootballReference (@pfref) <a href="https://twitter.com/pfref/status/686248371212935168">January 10, 2016</a></blockquote></center><p>Though the Vikings defense improved a month after that beat down, the offense didn't.
