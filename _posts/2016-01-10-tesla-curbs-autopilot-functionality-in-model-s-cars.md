<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">DETROIT</span> Tesla Motors said on Sunday it was updating the Autopilot driving systems in Model S sedans to put new limits on its hands-free operation, which has been both praised for its innovation while criticized for having been launched too early.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The function will now be restricted on residential roads or roads without a center divider, Tesla said, meaning that the car cannot drive faster than a maximum of the speed limit plus five miles per hour.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>When Autopilot launched in October, Chief Executive Elon Musk cautioned that the hotly anticipated function was in beta mode, or a test phase of development, with full "hands-off" driving not recommended. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Still, a host of subsequent videos posted by Tesla drivers on YouTube showed near-misses on the road with Autopilot, prompting Musk to say he would curb the function to minimize the possibility of people doing "crazy things."</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Tesla, the U.S. pioneer in luxury electric cars charged by batteries, was one of the first companies to offer a steering system that could be operated hands-free, one of the first steps to full self-driving that industry experts believe may be available by 2020.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>The car is able to keep to its lane using cameras, radars, GPS and mapping functions, but glitches can sometimes occur when roads are not clearly marked.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The company's expertise in software has allowed it to add the hands-free functionality through a software update, but critics have suggested the company should have delayed the Autopilot launch until it was perfect.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last week, the head of GM's global product development, Mark Reuss, said his company would "never" use over-the-air upgrades in safety-critical systems like steering and braking.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Besides curtailing functionality on residential roads, improvements have been made to help the car better stay in lanes even with faded lane markings, and when passing exits.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>In cruise control mode, the car will now anticipate highway exits by slowing down if you have activated your turn signal, Tesla said. </p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Tesla also said a Model S driver could now park their car from outside the vehicle in tight spots such as narrow garages. The car can also park itself in perpendicular spots to the curb.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><span id="midArticle_12"/><p> (Reporting By Alexandria Sage; Editing by <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=keith.weir&amp;">Keith Weir</a>)</p><span id="midArticle_13"/></div>
