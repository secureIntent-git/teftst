There has been speculation that Beijing might respond to the tribunal’s decision by building an artificial island at the reef, Scarborough Shoal, a move that could set off a conflict with the Philippines and its treaty ally, the United States.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="288" data-total-count="2412">The key issue before the panel was the legality of China’s claim to waters within a “nine dash line” that appears on official Chinese maps and encircles as much as 90 percent of the South China Sea, an area the size of Mexico. Beijing cites historical evidence to support the claim.</p> <figure id="south-china-sea-scarborough-shoal-philippines-hague" class="interactive promo  layout-large"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/07/10/world/asia/south-china-sea-scarborough-shoal-philippines-hague.html" readability="2">

Because the sovereignty of reefs and islands in the sea is disputed, Beijing asserted, the tribunal could not rule on competing claims to the surrounding waters. The treaty covers only maritime disputes, not land disputes.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="221" data-total-count="3181">On the eve of the ruling, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Lu Kang, said China would ignore the decision even if it was favorable to Beijing. “China has said this was illegal from the beginning,” he said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="247" data-total-count="3428">The issue has powerful ramifications for China’s domestic politics, as an integral part of the ruling Communist Party’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/07/11/china-believes-it-is-the-real-victim-in-the-south-china-sea-dispute/">narrative</a> is that after long periods of humiliation at the hands of bigger powers, China has regained its former greatness.</p><div id="story-ad-2" class="story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent">

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="279" data-total-count="6211" id="story-continues-5">But the unanimous ruling 30 years ago by the judges in The Hague emboldened congressional critics to cut funds for the administration’s campaign against the Sandinista government in Nicaragua, and it galvanized countries in Central America to seek a settlement of the conflict.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="303" data-total-count="6514">The tribunal ruling on the Philippines case has no enforcement mechanism: There is no international maritime police force, and China will not vacate or dismantle the artificial islands it has built on top of atolls in the Spratly archipelago. That makes the legal arguments important, the analysts said.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="283" data-total-count="6797">“In a way the tribunal will not solve the South China Sea issue but will heavily influence future negotiations,” said Markus Gehring, a lecturer in law at Cambridge University. “The tribunal rulings will move the goal posts towards the Philippines and the smaller countries.”</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="230" data-total-count="7027">Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam, all of which have claims in the South China Sea, will be reading the finding carefully to see what the tribunal says about the nine-dash line within which China asserts sovereignty.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="258" data-total-count="7285">In some areas, for example, the nine-dash line reaches inside waters where Indonesia controls economic activity under the Convention on the Law of the Sea. The treaty grants countries “exclusive economic zones” up to 200 nautical miles from their coasts.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="225" data-total-count="7510">When Chinese fishing boats operated this year in what Indonesia considers its waters near the Natuna Islands, Indonesian maritime forces tried to stop them. The Chinese Coast Guard then intervened to rescue the fishing boats.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="229" data-total-count="7739">The ruling in The Hague is specific to the Philippines and China, but Indonesia and the other claimants have hoped that a ruling calling the nine-dash line into question would bolster their ability to defend their economic zones.</p>        <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link" href="#whats-next">Continue reading the main story</a>
