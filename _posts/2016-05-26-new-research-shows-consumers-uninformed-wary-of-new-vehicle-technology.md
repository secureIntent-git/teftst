<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocation">DETROIT</span> Automakers investing billions in plug-in cars and self-driving vehicle systems are getting caution signals from new research that suggests many mainstream consumers don’t know what benefits they would get.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>A Harris Poll of 1,052 U.S. residents found that 67 percent didn’t know anyone who owned an electric car, a plug-in hybrid or a hybrid. </p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The research by Harris, which has conducted surveys in the United States since 1963, was released Thursday and commissioned by Ford Motor Co. The Dearborn, Mich. automaker is investing $4.5 billion by 2020 to expand its lineup of plug-in hybrid, all-electric and hybrid models. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>About 76 percent of those surveyed said they were “not at all sure” how far a plug-in hybrid car could drive on a single refueling and recharging. Plug-in hybrids run on electric power stored in batteries, and switch to a gasoline engine when the batteries run out of charge. </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The average of the respondents’ guesses as to a plug-in hybrid’s driving range was 260.8 miles, less than half the actual range of most plug-in hybrids on the market. The poll found more affluent consumers and city dwellers were more familiar with electric and hybrid vehicles. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Separately, a survey released Thursday in Britain found that 55 percent of 2,002 respondents said they were unlikely to want to be a passenger in a driverless car. The poll was conducted by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers/ICM Unlimited. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>A separate study by University of Michigan researcher Michael Sivak earlier this week found similar wariness of driverless vehicle technology among U.S. residents.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Tesla Motors Inc, the Silicon Valley vehicle maker, said it received 373,000 net orders for its Model 3 sedan based on showing a prototype vehicle that won’t be available until late 2017.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Still, sales of plug-in, hybrid and electric vehicles in the U.S. are less than 3 percent of the total market, according to industry sales figures.  Mainstream automakers are under pressure to sell more plug-in vehicles to comply with greenhouse gas emission limits and state electric car sales mandates.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Ford plans to step up efforts to sell plug-in hybrids such as the 2017 Ford Fusion Energi, which the company says has a 610 mile range, by staging events to allow customers to drive them, and creating new digital marketing to explain what the technology does. </p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>"The EV space is very fragmented," Ford Fusion marketing manager Wade Jackson told Reuters, referring to confusion over the different attributes of hybrids, plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles. "Not a lot of manufacturers have come up with a clear understanding of what each means."</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Among other efforts, Ford is also promoting road trips that plug-in hybrid owners could do on a single tank of gas, plus a battery charge. </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>"You can drive from San Diego to San Francisco," Jackson said.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><span id="midArticle_14"/><p> (Reporting By Joe White)</p><span id="midArticle_15"/></div>
