									<span class="marg-r-sm">This edge-on spiral galaxy might not look like much, but it’s actually quite the misfit. Known as LO95 0313-192, the galaxy has massive radio jets, outbursts of superheated gas moving close to the speed of light. Though not visible in this image, these giant jets were previously associated with spiral galaxies. Since its discovery over a decade ago, astronomers have located three more spiral galaxies with radio-emitting jets, raising more questions about how these jets are formed in galaxies and thrown out into the cosmos.</span><span class="credit"><span aria-hidden="true" role="presentation" class="ui ui-photo inline-block ui-credit relative opacity-5 marg-r-micro "/> <a> ESA/Hubble &amp; NASA</a></span>								</p>
