However, SeaWorld has said that whales raised or born in captivity would likely die in the wild.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>SeaWorld, whose shares have fallen about 11 percent in the past year, had also faced a backlash after the release of the 2013 documentary "Blackfish," which depicted the captivity and public exhibition of killer whales as inherently cruel.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>The company has sought to counter negative publicity surrounding "Blackfish" with a public relations blitz aimed at drawing attention to SeaWorld's role in marine mammal research and its rescue and rehabilitation of animals in the wild.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Dr. Naomi Rose, a marine biologist with the Animal Welfare Institute who was an adviser to the film, said in an email that SeaWorld's move was a "monumental and important first step forward in achieving a more humane business model for the company."</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>SeaWorld, which has not collected any orcas at sea for almost 40 years, has 29 of the marine mammals under its care, including six on loan to third parties.

        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>SeaWorld, which attracts about 20 million visitors a year, said it would introduce natural orca shows in place of theatrical performances, focusing on exercise and the animals' health. The changes will be implemented in San Diego next year and in its other parks by 2019.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>SeaWorld also said it would partner with the Humane Society of the United States to educate visitors. It has also set aside $50 million to advocate for an end to commercial whaling and seal hunting as well as the killing of sharks for their fins over the next five years.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><span id="midArticle_13"/><p> (Reporting by Ramkumar Iyer in Bengaluru; Editing by Ted Kerr)</p><span id="midArticle_14"/></div>
