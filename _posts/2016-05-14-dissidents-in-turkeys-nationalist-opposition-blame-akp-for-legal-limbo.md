<span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocation">ANKARA</span> Dissidents in Turkey's nationalist opposition accused the government on Saturday of interfering in an internal party dispute that could end up jeopardizing President Tayyip Erdogan's plans for more power.</p></span><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>Several hundred members of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) have launched a bid to oust Devlet Bahceli, leader for much of the last two decades, and to do so they need to change party rules at a special congress they want to hold on Sunday.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Four leaders of the revolt, including former interior minister Meral Aksener, issued a statement accusing Erdogan's AK Party of intervening to try to block the special congress.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Bahceli's faction sought an injunction to block the meeting but an Ankara court upheld the dissidents' countersuit. Only minutes later, state-broadcaster TRT reported verdicts from two other local courts that would halt the congress. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The MHP's dispute could be crucial for Erdogan because he needs its help to amend the constitution and give him more power. Dissident leader Aksener opposes that and polls say she could double support for MHP if she ousts Bahceli.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The AKP has increased its influence over the courts in recent years and its opponents say the legal chaos surrounding the congress results from its efforts to keep Bahceli in power.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"This is a direct intervention from the AK Party and government to the MHP congress and it is unacceptable," the dissidents said in a statement.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>They added that they would turn up at the hotel where the congress was scheduled to take place on Sunday.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Bahceli has led the MHP for much of the last two decades. His party won about 12 percent of the general election last November, getting 40 seats in parliament whose votes the AKP needs to call a referendum to amend the constitution.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Bahceli loyalists seem willing to do this, but Aksener, a former interior minister, has vowed she would defend Turkey's current parliamentary system and oppose Erdogan's plan.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>AKP officials reject any suggestions that the government or ruling party is influencing the courts, or that the MHP's leadership battle and AKP efforts to win its support on  constitutional change are in any way linked.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
