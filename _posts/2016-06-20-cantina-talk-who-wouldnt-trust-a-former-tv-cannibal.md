<br><div id=""><p>After the excitement/panic that surrounded the reshoots for <em>Rogue One</em> a couple of weeks ago, things have been relatively quiet when it comes to Star Wars news. Does this mean that peace has broken out in a galaxy far, far away, or just that everyone is too busy shooting their respective movies (or <a href="http://rcjohnso.tumblr.com/post/145623121700/in-the-home-stretch">ramping up for the final push</a>, in Rian Johnson’s <em>Episode VIII</em> case) to make appropriately exciting announcements? It’s possible that we should just get used to the silence for a couple weeks—with Comic-Con International a month away, it’s likely that any big news will be held until then. In the meantime, here are some rumors that have broken without official seals of approval.</p>
<h3><em>Episode VIII</em> Will Avoid One Long-Awaited Reveal and <em>Finally</em> Deliver Another</h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Online rumors from anonymous sources<br/><strong>Probability of Accuracy:</strong> Both seem possible, but whether or not they seem <em>likely</em> depends on how much you believe one particular fan theory.<br/><strong>The Real Deal:</strong> According to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2488496/board/thread/258127507?d=258127507#258127507">an anonymous poster on the IMDb forums of all places</a>, <em>Episode VIII</em> is not going to reveal that Luke Skywalker is Rey’s father—and, for that matter, neither will <em>Episode IX</em>. But don’t worry; there will be <em>something</em> in the movie guaranteed to drive fans wild, the same poster claimed: Leia will use the Force for the first time onscreen, to defend herself from an attack that will then leave her incapacitated for much of the movie. OK, so perhaps that last part isn’t what anyone has waited for. In fact, it’s such an unexpected move that it makes everything else seem a little suspicious as well. Why take Carrie Fisher out for so much of the movie, when she’s one of the people audiences want to see more of?</p>
<h3>What If Rey Was the New Anakin Skywalker?</h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Another anonymous Internet source<br/><strong>Probability of Accuracy:</strong> File this one under either “fan trolling” or “what the hell are they doing in the new movie?” It seems to be the former, but who knows?<br/><strong>The Real Deal:</strong> While Rey’s parentage may remain a mystery through <em>Episode VIII</em>, a new description of a scene from Rian Johnson’s upcoming movie suggests that audiences will at least find out what her role in the proceedings is, and that it’s a pretty important one. <a href="https://stormtrooperlarry.com/2016/06/15/star-wars-episode-viii-jedi-history-101/">According to a fan called “Ky10Rey,”</a> Rey will learn from Luke Skywalker and Yoda that she is destined to bring balance to the Force after finding out about the origin of the Jedi Order—an organization, it turns out, that was created for that very purpose. Two things about this rumor are telling: firstly, that Rey literally is given the destiny of Anakin Skywalker in the prequel trilogy (Hopefully, she’ll escape that whole “dark side” thing), and secondly, the origin of the Jedi Order references a special Force-sensitive tree, which ties it to both the animated <em>Clone Wars</em> series and last year’s <em>Journey to Star Wars: The Force Awakens: Shattered Empire</em> comic book series. Does that suggest that there’s a grand scheme being slowly unveiled and this rumor is genuine, or that whoever made it up had just watched <em>Clone Wars</em> on Netflix before writing this post?</p>
<h3>Who <em>Wouldn’t</em> Trust a Former Television Cannibal?</h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> The man who was Hannibal Lecter himself, Mads Mikkelsen<br/><strong>Probability of Accuracy:</strong> While he should be in the know, there’s every chance he’s simply playing PR clean-up this time around.<br/><strong>The Real Deal:</strong> After rumors started to circulate that up to 40 percent of <em>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</em> would be reshot this summer, Mads Mikkelsen <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/mads-mikkelsen-on-star-wars-rogue-one-reshoots-its-still-the-same-film-a7073981.html">told <em>The Independent</em> newspaper</a> that the reshoots aren’t that big of a deal, really. “Basically, all the big films I have done always have reshoots, it is part of their budget,” he said. “They’re either not super happy with a scene bit, the way we were acting, or maybe there’s something they want to add. It’s not a new thing, it happens with every film. Whether it’s bigger or less, I have no idea, I have nothing to compare with. It’s the same film, it’s just adding little bits here and there to do the final polishing. That’s my feeling.” That’s good news for those fearing the worst, assuming that Mads was telling the truth. Interestingly enough, he also suggested that Disney would be happy about all the rumors surrounding the movie being in trouble right now. “It’s free publicity,” he reasoned. Well, sure, but not <em>all</em> publicity is good publicity.</p>
<h3>Jedi Smell Like Patchouli</h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> A new line of Lucasfilm-approved merchandise<br/><strong>Probability of Accuracy:</strong> It <em>is</em> approved by Lucasfilm, so it’s probably true: Jedi smell like hippies.<br/><strong>The Real Deal:</strong> As <a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/new-star-wars-perfumes-finally-tell-us-what-jedi-are-me-1781950894">discovered by io9</a>, a German manufacturer called Lifestyle Perfumes is selling fragrances based on the Empire, the Jedi, and, surprisingly enough, Amidala (Natalie Portman’s character from the prequels). Details were revealed via Instagram:</p>

<p>On the plus side, the Empire top notes sound like they’d make a delicious tea.</p>
<h3>Fly the Friendly Skies in Your Own Virtual X-wing This Holiday Season</h3>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> Straight from the source itself, Electronic Arts<br/><strong>Probability of Accuracy:</strong> This was an official announcement, so it’s 100 percent guaranteed (barring technical problems).<br/><strong>The Real Deal:</strong> As part of its E3 announcements, EA <a href="http://starwars.ea.com/starwars/battlefront/news/x-wing-vr-mission-announce">revealed</a> that a VR mission will be released for <em>Star Wars: Battlefront</em> this holiday season, putting users in charge of their own X-wing as it explores space. No details about the mission were released, but it’s almost certainly not going to be a quiet trek around the galaxy. The game is currently in development, and it’s not alone: <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/ea-announces-three-new-star-wars-games-in-the-works/">three additional games are also in the works</a>, including an all-new story with all-new characters set in the Star Wars universe. Well, now that the Force has awakened, it’s got more time to play videogames.</p>
