<br><div id="start-of-content"><article class="content link-underline relative body-copy" data-js="content" itemprop="articleBody" readability="52.041095890411"><p>At 10am PDT on Monday June 13, Apple’s WWDC kicks off in San Francisco. We’ll be bringing you a liveblog, direct from the floor of Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, where Apple executives will give updates on iOS, Mac OS X, watchOS, and many other software, service, and hardware products. See our full rundown of <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/06/wwdc-2016-what-to-expect/">what to expect from WWDC</a>.</p>
<p>WIRED’s WWDC 2016 liveblog will begin about <strong>70 minutes</strong> before the event. So, tune in at 8:50am pacific or 11:50am eastern to follow our coverage. Want to watch it? <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/06/how-to-watch-wwdc-2016/">Instructions here</a>.</p>
<p>So, yeah, we’re going to liveblog it. Aren’t liveblogs dead, you ask? No, we say! We love liveblogs. And Apple WWDC Liveblogs are the absolute best.</p>
<p>Liveblogs are the easiest way for us to provide up-to-the-minute analysis of all the news as it’s announced. You can leave our liveblog open as you <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/06/how-to-watch-wwdc-2016/">watch the live event</a>. It sort of acts as a running commentary during a sports event (That’s right, Howard Cosell was the original liveblog host) and it’s a great way to access the deep knowledge of WIRED experts. Speaking of which, we’ll have our regular liveblog team of David Pierce and Brian Barrett keeping us up to date on all the news as it happens.</p>
<p>See you here Monday for our Apple WWDC liveblog! </p>
