Investigators now suspect that malware that allowed hackers to learn how to withdraw the money could have been installed several weeks before the incident, which took place between Feb. 4 and Feb. 5, the officials said.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Investigators suspect the attack was sophisticated, describing the use of a "zero day" and referring to an "advanced persistent threat", the officials said.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>A zero day is a vulnerability in software that has yet to be identified or patched. Hackers leverage this hole to plant malware on the target computer. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Advanced persistent threat is a long-term attack on a system, where hackers remain inside the target, for months, and sometimes even years.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>

Understanding how it happened could help banks shore up security of their computer systems and payment networks that form the backbone of global commerce.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Security experts say the perpetrators had deep knowledge of the Bangladeshi institution's internal workings, likely gained by spying on bank workers.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Bangladesh Bank officials have said hackers appeared to have stolen their credentials for the SWIFT messaging system, which banks around the world use for secure financial communication.     The Fed, which provides banking services to some 250 central banks and other institutions, has said its systems were not compromised.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>The Bangladesh central bank had billions of dollars in its current account, which it used for international settlements, officials have said.     </p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>The money stolen from the Bangladesh central bank made its way to the other side of the world. </p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
