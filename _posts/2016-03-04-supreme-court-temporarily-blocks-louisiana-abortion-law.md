        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The order noted that one of the eight justices, conservative Clarence Thomas, said he would have denied the application.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The order said the court's action was in line with its decision in June to temporarily block part of a Texas abortion law that was challenged by abortion providers in a high-profile case. The eight justices heard oral arguments in that case on Wednesday.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The Louisiana law mandates that physicians who perform abortions have "admitting privileges" at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the facility where abortions are performed. The regulation matches one in the Texas law.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
