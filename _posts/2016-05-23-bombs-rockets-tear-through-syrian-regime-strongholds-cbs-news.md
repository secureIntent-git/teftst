        <p><strong>DAMASCUS, Syria</strong> -- Syrian state TV said Monday that more than 65 people had been killed in multiple attacks in the coastal cities of Tartus and Jableh, strongholds of President Bashar Assad.</p><p>The TV report Monday said at least one suicide bomber on foot followed by a car bomber attacked a packed bus station in Tartus. An Interior Ministry official said more than 20 were killed and many injured.</p><p>The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/isis/" data-vanity-rewritten="true">ISIS</a>) claimed responsibility for the attacks in a statement posted online, saying they targeted members of the minority Alawite sect of Shiite Islam, to which Assad himself belongs. </p><p>Separately, Syria news agency SANA said three rockets were launched into Jableh, which lies 15 miles south of Latakia city, landing in a bus station, near the town's entrance.</p><p>Syrian officials said at least 45 people were killed in the explosions in Jableh. The toll from both blasts was expected to rise quickly.</p><p>Both towns have largely avoided major bloodshed during <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/syria-crisis/">Syria's five-year-old civil war</a>, which pits Assad and his allies Russia, Iran and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia against myriad rebel factions, including Islamic extremist groups <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/isis/" data-is-autolink="true">ISIS</a> and al Qaeda's affiliate the Nusra Front.</p><p>The rare attacks occurred in the normally quiet pro-government coastal areas where Russia keeps a naval base in Tartus and an air base in Latakia province. Insurgents maintain a presence in rural Latakia.</p><p>The same bus station was attacked in Jableh in 2012, but Monday's bombings in Tartus were the first to hit the city since the war began as an uprising against Assad's rule in 2011.</p>
