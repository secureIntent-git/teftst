<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="6"><p><span class="articleLocation">DETROIT</span> Tesla Motors Inc said orders for its new Model 3 electric sedan topped 253,000 in the first 36 hours -- a fast start for the company's first mass-market vehicle, which may not begin to reach customers for another 18 months or more.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk tweeted on Friday that the Model 3, which is slated to go into production in late 2017, will sell at an average price of $42,000, including the price of options and additional features, which would give the initial flurry of orders an estimated retail value of $10.6 billion.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>That intense interest, fanned in part by a steady stream of tweets by Musk, could help boost Tesla's stock price, which closed Friday at $237.59, up 3.4 percent. The stock has soared more than 60 percent since hitting a 12-month low in February.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The car's average selling price projected by Musk is well above the $35,000 base price. Analysts earlier had estimated the first Model 3s off the factory line in Fremont, California, could be loaded with extra equipment and sell for $50,000 to$60,000.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Tesla has undertaken a costly expansion of the Fremont plant, aiming to boost annual capacity to 500,000 by 2020, with production of the Model 3, the company's first mass-market car, ramping up slowly through 2019. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Some analysts said the company could have trouble filling all the initial Model 3 orders, which are accompanied by a refundable $1,000 deposit, until 2020.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Barclays analyst Brian Johnson on Friday said the heavy influx of Model 3 orders "sets the stage for an equity offering" later this year by Tesla, much of which would go toward factory construction and product development. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Johnson had estimated Tesla could take 250,000-300,000 orders for the car by the end of June.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Musk unveiled a prototype of the Model 3, a smaller companion to the Model S sedan and Model X utility vehicle, amid considerable fanfare on Thursday night.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Some prospective buyers who placed early orders may have anticipated paying a lower price for the Model 3 after factoring in a $7,500 federal tax credit on electric cars. But that credit begins to phase out once manufacturers sell more than 200,000 EVs - a mark that Tesla, at its current sales pace, is likely to surpass next year before the first Model 3 is delivered.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><span id="midArticle_11"/><p> (Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Alan Crosby)</p><span id="midArticle_12"/></div>
