"I thought he walked, but it wasn't called, so that's the way it goes."</p><p>After the timeout, Westbrook was immediately fouled, and he hit one of two free throws to make it a two-possession game. The Thunder emerged with a 108-102 win at Oracle Arena.</p><p>NBA senior vice president of replay and referee operations Joe Borgia acknowledged in a postgame interview on NBA TV that a traveling violation should have been called on Westbrook.</p><p>"The officials, no one could get in a good position to see him drag that pivot foot," Borgia said. "It's an unfortunate miss, but so much going on in the play, the speed of it, and officiating is about getting angles and sometimes you just can't get them, and they did not get a great angle on that play."</p><p>Westbrook kept his analysis of the controversial no-call to a minimum.</p><p>"I just play until I hear the whistle," said Westbrook, who had 27 points, 12 assists, seven steals and six rebounds to lead the Thunder to a comeback from a 13-point halftime deficit.</p><p>The Thunder benefitted twice from incorrect no-calls in the final minute of their conference semifinals series win over the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nba/team/_/name/sa/san-antonio-spurs">San Antonio Spurs</a>. As was the case in Monday's victory, Oklahoma City was protecting a one-possession lead on both occasions in the conference semifinals.</p>
