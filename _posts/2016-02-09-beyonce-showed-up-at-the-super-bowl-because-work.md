<br><div id=""><p>About a million people were expected to show up in San Francisco for Super Bowl 50. And the city only has about 35,000 or so hotel rooms. So some entrepreneurially minded residents did the math and thought they could make a killing over Super Bowl weekend by renting out rooms or homes on Airbnb.</p>
<p>So the listings came. <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeIsaac/status/695354006059626496">More than $1,000 for a night</a> in San Francisco’s Tenderloin district. Or how about <a href="http://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Why-Airbnb-hosts-aren-t-scoring-riches-on-Super-6802767.php">$25,000 for five nights</a> at a three-bedroom house 10 minutes away from Levi’s Stadium (which isn’t close to San Francisco at all.</p>

	'You get this glut of supply in the market, with thousands of extra listings at ridiculous prices.'	<span class="attribution">Ian McHenry, co-founder of Beyond Pricing</span>
</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.airbnb.com/superimpact-superbowl/?af=14383374&amp;c=tw_us_SB16_brand">According to Airbnb’s estimates</a>, more than 15,000 Super Bowl fans and others stayed with hosts in the Bay Area—four times more than at the same time last year. But not everyone made away with a small fortune, says Ian McHenry, the co-founder of <a href="https://beyondpricing.com/">Beyond Pricing</a>, a service that helps Airbnb hosts figure out how much to charge. At their peak, listings for short-term rentals in the days leading up to the Super Bowl reached 9,000—but the data also showed only 52 percent occupancy, according to Beyond Pricing’s data. Last year, McHenry says, the data showed a 67 percent occupancy rate in the same period.</p>
<p>How did this happen? It’s the same cycle each year with the Super Bowl, McHenry explains. The NFL buys up blocks of rooms at hotels in the area, and prices shoot up. The media picks up on the news, and people start listing their apartments or houses at similarly high prices. But because there are so many hosts hoping to catch in, according to McHenry, the host city tends to end up with an over-supply. “You get this glut of supply in the market, with thousands of extra listings at ridiculous prices,” McHenry says. “But because of that over-supply, the majority of them don’t get booked. It’s Econ 101.”</p>
<p>Closer to the game, he says, the hotels open up their inventory with rooms that the NFL no longer needs—around the same time people are jumping on Airbnb and other platforms. “They don’t want them to sit empty,” McHenry says.</p>
<p>He also points out that because of the San Francisco Bay Area’s geography, the math most people had been doing doesn’t even add up in the end. “It’s about the balance between the number of hotels and how spread out the events are,” McHenry says. In the Bay Area, the Super Bowl events were mostly held in the city, while the game was in Santa Clara and hour south. Spread out across the entire Bay Area, he said, the total number of hotel rooms climbs to about 100,000.</p>
<p>Besides, McHenry says, a huge chunk of the million or so “visitors” to the Super Bowl events in the city were probably people who already lived in the Bay Area. Sometimes a home is just a home.</p>
