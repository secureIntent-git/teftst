<br><div id="start-of-content"><p>Surprise, surprise: The Internet is excited about <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/01/heres-the-trailer-for-the-surprise-cloverfield-sequel/" target="_blank"> <em>10 Cloverfield Lane</em></a>. But millions of YouTube views are still a drop in the ocean compared to the <a href="http://www.wired.com/2007/07/code-name-clove-2/" target="_blank">tidal</a> <a href="http://www.wired.com/2007/07/code-name-clo-1/" target="_blank">wave of</a> <a href="http://www.wired.com/2007/11/code-name-clove/" target="_blank">Internet</a> <a href="http://www.wired.com/2007/12/infected-by-clo/" target="_blank">involvement</a> that led up to its spiritual predecessor, 2008’s <em>Cloverfield</em>. Most of that fuss, as you’ll recall, was sparked by the movie’s ARG (Alternate Reality Game), which had players scouring the web and congregating on <a href="http://forums.unfiction.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=19964" target="_blank">message boards</a> for clues and easter eggs before <em>Cloverfield</em>‘s title was even announced. Cryptic hints and wild speculation about 1-18-08, Slusho, Tagruato, T.I.D.O Wave, and the Ethan Haas controversy flooded forums for a full six months back, and remain one of most intriguing marketing campaigns in movie history.</p>
<p>Domains, though, are rarely permanent. Some expire, some are sold, some are left there like the <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/sports/features/space-jam-forever-the-website-that-wouldnt-die-20150819" target="_blank">husk of a bygone era</a>…and some just fade away, gathering dust in the sands of the Wayback Machine. We revisited the <em>Cloverfield</em> ARG sites that started it all—the genuine articles and red herrings alike—to see how they’ve fared over the past eight-plus years.</p>
