<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">NEW YORK</span> Former Wall Street executive Andrew Caspersen pleaded guilty on Wednesday to charges that he defrauded investors out of over $38 million, blaming his conduct on a gambling addiction he could not control.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Caspersen, who worked at a unit of investment banker Paul Taubman's PJT Partners Inc prior to his arrest in March, pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan to securities fraud and wire fraud.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Caspersen, who graduated from Princeton University and Harvard Law School, choked up in court as he admitted to cheating numerous people, mostly family and friends, through what he called a "simple" fraud.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"It was just a means for me to get money to feed a gambling addition that was all consuming at the time," Caspersen said.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>As part of a plea deal, Caspersen, 39, agreed to not appeal any sentence beyond 15-2/3 years in prison and to forfeit over $45 million, though his lawyer, Paul Shechtman, said he cannot afford that sum. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Nov. 2.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Prosecutors said Caspersen, the son of late Wall Street financier Finn M.W.

The advisory firm was spun off from private equity group Blackstone Group LP in October and is now part of PJT Partners.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>In court, Caspersen said he told friends and family that a private equity firm had given him an allocation in a "practically riskless debt instrument" and then offered them a chance to invest with him.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Instead, prosecutors said he used the $38.5 million he raised to make options trades, to pay earlier investors, and to replace over $8 million he had misappropriated from Park Hill Group, which Caspersen said he also used for gambling.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>In total, he attempted to raise almost $150 million, prosecutors said.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>His victims included a foundation affiliated with hedge fund Moore Capital Management and one of the fund's employees, who together were cheated out of $25 million, prosecutors said.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/>

Caspersen, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-cr-0414.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><span id="midArticle_15"/><p> (Reporting by Nate Raymond in New York; Editing by David Gregorio and Andrew Hay)</p><span id="midArticle_16"/></div>
