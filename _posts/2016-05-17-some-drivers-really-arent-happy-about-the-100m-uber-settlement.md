<br><div id=""><p>Many more Uber drivers in California can now join a class-action lawsuit filed against the ride-hail giant over their employment status, a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2644451-395-00-Supplemental-Order-on-Class-Cert.html">US federal judge has ruled</a>.</p>
<p>The ruling handed down today in San Francisco by US District Judge Edward Chen allows Uber drivers who agreed as part of their contracts to settle disputes in arbitration to join the lawsuit nevertheless. Three plaintiffs had initially brought the complaint against Uber seeking mileage and tip reimbursement from the company, which is now <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/12/ubers-raising-billions-more-so-why-bother-going-public/">valued at $62.5 billion</a>. Currently, Uber considers those drivers independent contractors, not official employees of the company, meaning they must shoulder those expenses themselves. The suit seeks to have drivers classified as employees.</p>
<p>Additionally, Chen has allowed the drivers’ related expenses, which includes fuel, maintenance and repairs, among other things, to be included part of the suit’s claims, a decision he deferred when he <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/09/judge-california-drivers-can-go-class-action-sue-uber/">granted class-action status to the lawsuit in September</a>.</p>
<p>“This is a significant ruling on both counts and we are very pleased with it,” Shannon Liss-Riordan, the Boston lawyer who is representing Uber drivers in the case, said in an emailed statement to WIRED.</p>
<p>Uber said it plans to “immediately appeal” the court’s ruling.</p>
<p>The expansion of the lawsuit is incremental but important. The class-action suit, and any trial that follows, could have an immense impact on the so-called on-demand economy, which largely depends on the work of independent contractors. And of <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/09/doordash-grubhub-caviar-labor-suits/">the slew of complaints filed against on-demand companies</a>, the Uber lawsuit is the furthest along in court.</p>
<p>But Chen’s ruling today does still exclude a number of groups from participating in the suit: drivers who work for limo companies—which includes one of the three plaintiffs in the original suit; and individuals who have registered to drive for Uber under a corporate name.</p>
<p>Following the court’s initial decision to certify the suit as a class action, Uber <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/09/uber-class-action-blog/">tried to downplay the ruling</a>, asserting that the number of California drivers who could sue was far fewer than the 160,000 or so Uber drivers in California. According to the company’s estimates back then, less than 10 percent—about 15,000 drivers—would be eligible to join the suit, in part because the company said drivers who signed up with the service after June 2014 agreed to waive their right to participate in class action suits against the company in favor of arbitration. Now, Uber concedes it’s unclear on how many drivers will be able to join the suit.</p>
<p><em>The New York Times</em> has sought to show, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/01/business/dealbook/arbitration-everywhere-stacking-the-deck-of-justice.html">in a recent series</a>, that corporations have been increasingly inserting arbitration clauses into consumer and employment contracts in a bid to handle disputes privately instead of letting individuals get their day in court.</p>
