The prosecution had sought 12-1/2 years in federal prison, while Fogle's attorneys had asked for five years. Fogle also was fined $175,000.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Fogle's attorney, Ronald Elberger, said the sentence handed down by U.S. District Judge Tanya Walton Pratt was based on things his client did not actually do, including producing child pornography or acting on fantasies of having sex with minors. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"Even though he talked about it, that's all he did," Elberger said at the hearing. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>At Fogle's sentencing hearing, prosecutors said he asked prostitutes to find him younger prostitutes. Fogle did not appear in court on Friday.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>It will take some time for the appeals court to issue an opinion, Elberger said.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>U.S. Attorney Steven DeBrota said the punishment was justified, because Fogle knew some of the minor victims by name and on a personal level. </p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>"He was obsessed with having sex with minors," DeBrota said.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Subway fired Fogle when reports of the plea agreement emerged. He has already begun to pay $1.4 million in restitution to 14 victims who are minors.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Fogle obtained child pornography given to him by Russell Taylor, the former director of Fogle's charitable foundation, including videos he taped of minors without their permission, using hidden cameras in his homes in Indiana.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>The foundation involved educational programs about childhood obesity.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Taylor pleaded guilty to child pornography charges and was sentenced to 27 years in prison.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><span id="midArticle_15"/><p> (Editing by Fiona Ortiz and Matthew Lewis)</p><span id="midArticle_16"/></div>
