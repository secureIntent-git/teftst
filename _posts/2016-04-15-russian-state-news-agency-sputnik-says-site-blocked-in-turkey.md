We've sent a letter to the regulatory agency asking for the reasons. We were not expecting a ban at all," Mahir Boztepe told Reuters.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>No one was available for comment at Turkey's telecoms and internet regulatory agency.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>In a statement, Sputnik's top editor, Margarita Simonyan, described the blocking as "a further act of harsh censorship" in Turkey and said the site had been blocked late on Thursday, hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin made comments criticizing "some political leaders" in Turkey.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Relations between the former Cold War rivals hit their worst level in recent memory after Turkey shot down a Russian warplane over Syria in November, saying it had strayed into Turkish air space.

        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Human rights groups and some Turkish media decry what they say has been an unprecedented crackdown on opposition voices in Turkey. Several opposition newspapers have been confiscated or closed in recent months and broadcasters taken off the air, accused of terrorist activities, while critical academics have been detained under broad anti-terrorism laws.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><span id="midArticle_8"/><p> (Reporting by Can Sezer in Istanbul and Alexander Winning in Moscow; Writing by David Dolan; Editing by Gareth Jones)</p><span id="midArticle_9"/></div>
