That’s exactly what we’ve done. And we’re now asking for Congress to give it fair consideration. And I’m not going to speculate at this point if Congress refuses to do that.”</p><p>Unilateral action would spark a major partisan battle and potentially open up the Obama administration to litigation. </p><p>Congress has passed defense policy bills over the last several years that ban the transfer of detainees to the U.S. mainland. Obama has signed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) each year, but last November, he included a statement blasting those restrictions. </p><p>The Gitmo prison currently houses 91 detainees. Under Obama’s proposal, the administration would transfer 35 who are deemed to pose a lower security risk back to their home countries or third countries over the next few months. </p><p>Another 10 are being tried by military commissions. Many of the remaining 46 detainees would be kept in a new facility on U.S. soil, designed to hold between 30 and 60 prisoners.</p><p>The cost of building a new prison would range from $290 million to $475 million, but the plan touts $65 million to $85 million in savings on operating costs compared to Guantánamo. </p><p>Republican lawmakers have long been dead set against changing the law to move detainees to the U.S. mainland, and they raised new objections to Obama’s latest plan. </p><p>Pentagon officials looked at 13 potential facilities, including military prisons in Kansas and South Carolina and a federal prison in Colorado. But the plan does not identify a specific replacement site. </p><p>“I have pledged to give the president’s plan a fair hearing, but he makes it impossible to do so when he withholds critical details,” said Rep. Mac Thornberry (R-Texas), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. </p><p>Earnest initially blamed Congress for the lack of explicit alternative, pointing to language in the NDAA that bans federal dollars from being used to “construct or modify” U.S. facilities for Guantánamo detainees. </p><p>But another section of the bill calls on the administration to submit a “specific facility or facilities” to house detainees in its proposal. </p><p>When asked about the discrepancy, the spokesman said it highlighted “yet another example of congressional dysfunction — that they have written a law that includes varying guidance.”</p><p>Republicans also seized on the arrest Tuesday of a former Guantánamo Bay detainee as part of a Spanish terrorism investigation. </p><p>They argued the incident showed flaws in the administration’s strategy of transferring prisoners overseas. But Earnest called the incident the exception and not the rule, saying the recidivism rate for former detainees is in the “single digits.”</p><p>The proposal also made waves on the 2016 campaign trail.
