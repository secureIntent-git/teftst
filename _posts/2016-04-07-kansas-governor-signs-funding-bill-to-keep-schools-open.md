Justices also warned that schools would be ordered to close if the legislature failed to take action by June 30.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>"This bill is the result of a delicate legislative compromise – one that I respectfully endorse and that the court should review with appropriate deference,” the Republican governor said in a statement.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>But Alan Rupe, an attorney representing four public school districts that sued the state, said the new law does not remedy the inequity problem and that he will ask the supreme court to review the law.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/>
