<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">SEOUL</span> South Korean Lee Sedol won his first match against a computer program developed by a Google subsidiary on Sunday in the ancient board game Go, denying a clean sweep for the artificial intelligence in a five-match series.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Lee, one of the world's top players and a holder of 18 international titles, recovered from three consecutive losses against the AlphaGo program developed by DeepMind.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>"This win is invaluable and I would not trade it for anything else in the world," a jubilant Lee told reporters after the match, thanking fans for their support. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The 33-year-old professional player has admitted to underestimating AlphaGo's skills but also said the program was not perfect, asking supporters to keep watching the contest.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis told reporters the loss was a valuable learning tool and would help identify weaknesses in the program that his team needed to address.    </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>"It's a real testament to Mr Lee's incredible fighting spirit and he was able to play so brilliantly today after three defeats," Hassabis said.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Go, most popular in countries such as China, South Korea and Japan, involves two contestants moving black and white stones on a square grid, with the aim of seizing the most territory.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Experts did not expect an artificial intelligence program to beat a human professional for at least a decade, until AlphaGo beat a European champion player last year. Lee was considered a much more formidable opponent, however. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Google executives say Go offers too many possible moves for a machine to win simply through brute-force calculations, unlike chess, in which IBM's Deep Blue famously beat former world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Instead, they said, AlphaGo has sought to approximate human intuition, by studying old matches and using simulated games to hone itself independently.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>The fifth and final match is scheduled for Tuesday. </p><span id="midArticle_11"/><span id="midArticle_12"/><p> (Additional reporting by Hooyeon Kim; Editing by Ed Davies)</p><span id="midArticle_13"/></div>
