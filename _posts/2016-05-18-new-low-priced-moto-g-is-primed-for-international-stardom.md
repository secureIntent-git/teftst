<br><div id=""><p>For a long time now, <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/05/cheap-smartphones/">cheap phones have been excellent</a>. Many reasonably priced phones have the cameras, screen sizes, and battery life of last year’s flagships, as well as deal-sweeteners like expandable storage.</p>
<p data-js="fader" class="pullquote carve fader">
	Lenovo will trot out three versions of the Moto G this year.	<span class="attribution"/>
</p>
There’s even a new category of phone emerging: Step-down “budget flagships” such as the LG Nexus 5X, the Huawei Honor 5X, and of course, the insanely popular <a href="http://motorola-blog.blogspot.com/2016/05/meet-new-moto-g-family-whichever-you.html">Moto G</a>. The low-priced handset, little brother to the more powerful Moto X, is the best-selling Motorola-branded smartphone in history, and it’s Motorola’s best-selling phone not named the Razr.
<p>Now there’s a budget-flagship inception, as the 2016 version of the Moto G will have step-up and step-down models of its own. Announced today, Lenovo (which bought Motorola in 2014) will trot out three versions of the Moto G this year. Pricing for the U.S. market hasn’t been announced yet—that’s one of the most interesting aspects of these new phones—but they’re all due this summer.</p>
<figure attachment_2020936="" class="wp-caption landscape alignnone  relative" data-js="fader"><img src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/New-Low-Priced-Moto-G-Is-Primed-for-International-Stardom.jpg" alt="Moto G Plus." width="1024" height="768" class="size-large wp-image-2020936"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text link-underline">Moto G Plus.<span class="credit link-underline-sm"><span aria-hidden="true" class="ui ui ui-photo inline-block ui-credit relative opacity-6 marg-r-sm marg-l-sm"/>Motorola</span></figcaption></figure><p>There’s the standard-issue Moto G, with an eight-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 chip, 2GB RAM, a fast-charging 3000mAh battery, a 5.5-inch HD display, a microSD slot in addition to its 16GB or 32GB drive, and a 13-megapixel main camera. The sum of all those parts is a very similar phone to the Moto X from late 2014, albeit with a bigger screen and a longer-life battery.</p>
<p>Then there’s a step-up model, the logically named Moto G Plus. There’s no change with the battery, the processor, the screen, or the custom design options. However, it has a fingerprint reader and its higher-resolution 16-megapixel camera has phase-detection autofocus. The Plus configuration also boosts the RAM to 4GB and the internal storage capacity to 64GB.</p>
<p><figure attachment_2020938="" class="carve wp-caption portrait alignnone  relative" data-js="fader"><img src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1463554816_837_New-Low-Priced-Moto-G-Is-Primed-for-International-Stardom.jpg" alt="Moto G Play." width="289" height="385" class="size-inset-image wp-image-2020938"/><figcaption class="wp-caption-text link-underline">Moto G Play.<span class="credit link-underline-sm"><span aria-hidden="true" class="ui ui ui-photo inline-block ui-credit relative opacity-6 marg-r-sm marg-l-sm"/>Motorola</span></figcaption></figure>The lower-end Moto G Play is less compelling, with a lower-end processor, an 8-megapixel camera, and a 5-inch screen. It doesn’t have the custom backplate options, and it’s only available in a 16GB model with a microSD slot.</p>
<p>Prices haven’t been finalized, but last year’s 16GB Moto G started at around $200 for the unlocked base configuration. Expect the same for the new Moto G, even if it has a sharper screen, a longer-life battery, and more-powerful components.</p>
<p>While U.S. customers will have to wait for the new G phones, Lenovo is making the Moto G and Moto G Plus available in Brazil immediately, while the Moto G Plus will also be available in India today. Shrewd, as it plays right into the phone’s wheelhouse: Huge, growing smartphone markets. </p>
<p>Last year, the Moto G was the best-selling smartphone in Brazil. It was also very popular in India, which <a href="http://qz.com/608005/india-has-overtaken-the-us-to-become-the-worlds-second-largest-smartphone-market/">recently leapfrogged the U.S.</a> as the world’s second-biggest smartphone market. The combined populations of Brazil and India are bigger than that of China.</p>
