DelReal and Robert Costa: “The strength and the weakness of his campaign have been Trump himself, who functions as his own chief strategist, consultant, policy czar and communications guru. And that is the same way he built his fortune, said spokeswoman Hope Hicks. ‘In real estate, he builds a building. It doesn’t matter who the vendors are, or who the designer is. His name is on it; it’s his product,’ she said. And he approached the campaign similarly: ‘My name is on this, and nobody else really matters.’ The limitations of that approach have become apparent as the campaign has been spread more thinly and competition has narrowed.”</p> <p>-- <strong>“It was a loss for Trump, yes, but more important, a galvanizing moment for the forces aligned against him,”</strong> <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/433694/how-donald-trump-lost-wisconsin">writes National Review Washington bureau chief Eliana Johnson</a>.</p> <p>-- <strong>“A hard truth is emerging for the GOP: at a moment where the frontrunner should be getting stronger, Trump is getting weaker," </strong><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/analysis-donald-trump-grows-weaker-setting-republican-chaos/story?id=38165062">ABC political director Rick Klein</a> writes.

For Trump and Cruz, winning states certainly remains important. But every delegate denied to Trump will be considered a small but important victory by the anti-Trump forces.”</p> <p><strong>-- Trump plans to give a series of policy speeches</strong> <strong>to show</strong> <strong>he’s “presidential,”</strong> addressing topics such as how he'd strengthen the nation’s military, how he'd reform education and the criteria by which he would select Supreme Court justices. Ben Carson said he spoke with Trump by phone yesterday about a list of “10 to 12 justices” from whom Trump is considering to fill the court vacancy.

Beyond that, 81 of those delegates are distributed on the basis of results in the state’s 27 congressional districts. Trump could gain 14 delegates if he wins more than 50 percent of the statewide vote. Otherwise, he will share those delegates with any rival who tops 20 percent. In any congressional district where he falls short of 50 percent, even if he has the plurality of votes, he will give up one of the three delegates awarded in each of those districts. If he runs second in any district, he would pick up just one delegate.”</p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" readability="6.4770114942529"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trump's big loss in WI doesn't shut down road to 1237, but removes margin of error.

Then Cruz brought his wife, Heidi, the subject of a nasty feud with Trump and his fans, to the podium and showered praise on her.”</p> <p>“Tonight is a turning point.
