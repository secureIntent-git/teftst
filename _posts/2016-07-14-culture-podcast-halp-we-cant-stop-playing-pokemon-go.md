<br><div id="start-of-content"><article class="content link-underline relative body-copy" data-js="content" itemprop="articleBody" readability="51.437865972674"><p>When you cover culture, you spend a lot of time inside: in movie theaters, in living rooms, in offices hunched over desks. The job demands it. This past week, our work took us to this magical, wonderful place called “outside.” And, as luck would have it, it was quite nice! </p>



<p>But just because we were in the sun that doesn’t mean we weren’t still glued to our screens consuming entertainment. It’s just that the biggest pop culture moment this week was <em>Pokémon Go</em>, the augmented reality mobile game that sent everyone into the streets to catch themselves some Geodudes. The app had everyone—including most of the WIRED staff—rapt this past weekend and its left the <em>Monitor</em> crew unable to do—or talk about—anything else. (Sure, we could’ve gone to see <em>The Secret Life of Pets</em> or something, but why would we?) </p>
<p>What about you, dear listener? Were you also taken up in the Poké-rapture? Well, if you feel like commiserating about it, the WIRED Culture team is here for you. We’ve got editors and writers <a href="http://www.wired.com/author/peterrubin/" target="_blank">Peter Rubin</a>, <a href="http://www.wired.com/author/awatercutter/" target="_blank">Angela Watercutter</a>, and <a href="http://www.wired.com/author/kevin-mcfarland/" target="_blank">K.M. McFarland</a> all back in action after the Fourth of July weekend and we’ve got a lot of things to say—catch ’em all! </p>
<p>A few helpful links for things we talk about in the podcast:</p>
