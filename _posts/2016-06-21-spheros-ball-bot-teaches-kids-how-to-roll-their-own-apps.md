<br><div id="start-of-content"><article class="content link-underline relative body-copy" data-js="content" itemprop="articleBody" readability="49.875"><p>Sphero, that cute robotic ball that proves that <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/12/how-bb-8a-rolling-robot-in-a-galaxy-far-far-awaychanged-everything-for-sphero/">BB-8’s underlying physics</a> work, is more than a toy. It’s a great way of teaching children how to code. Kids have made everything from <a href="https://sprk.sphero.com/cwists/72/preview">sea vessels</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obw31l-onFU">modern art</a> with the little ball-bot.</p>
<p>The company just updated the SPRK edition designed specifically for tinkering. The Sphero SPRK+ features a more scratch-resistant transparent body so youngsters can see what’s inside. Pairing the ball to a phone is simpler; you can just tap the two together to sync them up. A revamped app also helps teachers hone their students’ programming skills.</p>
<p>The Lightning App allows students and teachers to create and share programs with anyone (think of it as GitHub for rolling robots) so they can do things like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FliOIpygzng">power a Strandbeest</a>. The update adds sound effects to the list of programmable features, and there’s also a news feed to keep them posted about new projects to play around with.</p>
<p>Sphero says it designed the $130 SPRK+ and its OVAL programming language for kindergartners and college students alike. Youngsters can drag and drop puzzle pieces into various sequences to make Sphero change colors, roll in a given direction, or perform other simple tasks. More sophisticated programmers can dive right into the code to take advantage of the robot’s gyroscope, motor, processor, Bluetooth module, and LEDs.</p>
<p>Of course, you don’t have <a href="https://sprk.sphero.com/cwists/79/preview">build a model solar system</a> to enjoy all of those features. You can do more pedestrian things like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra6kg-rCx_Y">baffle your cat</a>.</p>
