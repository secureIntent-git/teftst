  <p>The two spoke separately in describing Ali's condition that they say is concerning to family members. They declined to be identified because they were not speaking on behalf of the family.</p><p>A spokesman for Ali said in a statement earlier Thursday that the former heavyweight champion is being treated at an unidentified hospital for a respiratory issue.
