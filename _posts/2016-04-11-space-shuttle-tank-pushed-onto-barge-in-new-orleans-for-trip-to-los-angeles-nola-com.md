                This undated photo provided by the California Science Center shows an External Fuel Tank built for the space shuttle sitting on a transporter, like the one that will take ET-94 across the city streets in Los Angeles and Inglewood, Calif. The external tank built for the space shuttle program but never used will travel through the Panama Canal and eventually along the busy roadways of Los Angeles. The 65,000-pound propellant tank is destined for the California Science Center, permanent home of the retired space shuttle Endeavour.

		<p>LOS ANGELES — ET-94, a massive external fuel tank built for the space shuttle program but never used in flight, is on an ocean barge bound for Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The 15-story, 32½-ton tank began its epic journey on Sunday when crews pushed it across a NASA assembly facility in New Orleans onto the barge, <a href="http://lat.ms/1qIzrRR" target="_blank">the Los Angeles Times reported.</a></p>
<p>The tank will pass through the Panama Canal and dock in Marina Del Rey for the start of a 12-mile drive on highways and streets to the California Science Center. That's where it will be permanently displayed with the retired space shuttle Endeavour.
</p><p>NASA agreed last year to donate ET-94, called a lightweight tank, to the downtown Los Angeles museum. It is the last surviving external propellant tank that was built for shuttle missions.</p>
