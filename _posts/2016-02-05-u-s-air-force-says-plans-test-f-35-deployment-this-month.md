<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="6"><p><span class="articleLocation">NELLIS AIR FORCE BASE, Nevada</span> The U.S. Air Force will deploy four Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 fighter jets to a different U.S. air base this month as it assesses whether the new warplane can be declared combat-ready by August as planned, a senior officer told Reuters on Thursday.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Major General Jay Silveria, who heads the U.S. Air Force Warfare Center at Nellis Air Force Base, said the F-35 jets would be sent from the Nevada base to Mountain Home Air Force Base in southwestern Idaho later this month. </p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>The deployment would include pilots, mechanics, spare parts, equipment and the plane's computerized logistics system to test the ability to deploy the plane for combat, he said.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The test would help the Air Force assess its ability to send the jets to other locations and ensure that they can be repaired and maintained, Silveria said.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>"What weâ€™re trying to do is exercise the deployment concepts and to learn from maintenance and learn from (operations)," Silveria said.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Like any warplane, maintenance of the F-35 requires specialized tools and materials, and it was critical that all those tools travel with the jet when it deployed, he said.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Silveria said the test deployment was part of an assessment of whether an initial squadron of F-35 jets was ready for combat. He said the warfare center was due to deliver that "operational readiness assessment" to General Hawk Carlisle, head of Air Combat Command, in July.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Carlisle would use the assessment to help decide whether an initial squadron of F-35A fighter jets was ready for combat. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Silveria, a pilot who also flies the F-35, said the 12 F-35s based at Nellis Air Force Base were performing well in regular exercises with other aircraft, and had proven their ability to share data and communicate with fourth-generation jets. </p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>He said the jets were now also able to share data within a formation of four F-35 jets flying together - a capability he experienced during a flight in the past week.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>The Air Force hoped to declare that it had an "initial operational capability" of F-35s between August and December. </p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>The U.S. Marine Corps declared an initial squadron of 10 of its F-35B model jets ready for combat last July. The F-35B can take off from shorter runways and land like a helicopter, </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Two Air Force F-35s are slated to have their first international deployment when they fly to Britain in July to participate in two British air shows.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><span id="midArticle_14"/><p> (Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/search/journalist.php?edition=us&amp;n=paul.tait&amp;">Paul Tait</a>)</p><span id="midArticle_15"/></div>
