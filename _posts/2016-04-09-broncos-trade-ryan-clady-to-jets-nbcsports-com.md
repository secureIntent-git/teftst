<p><a class="nameLink" href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/4616/ryan-clady">Ryan Clady</a> has been traded from the Broncos to the Jets, Adam Schefter of ESPN reports. The trade comes a day after news broke that <a class="nameLink" href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/3620/dbrickashaw-ferguson">D’Brickashaw Ferguson</a>, the Jets’ starting left tackle for the last decade, has decided to retire.</p>
<p>According to Schefter, the trade will see the Jets ship a fifth-round pick to Denver in exchange for Clady and a seventh-round pick. That might not sound like much, but considering that Clady is due a $9.5 million salary and has missed 30 games in the last three years, the Broncos may feel lucky that they got anything for him.</p>
<p>If the 29-year-old Clady can get healthy and play like he did at his best, he may be an upgrade from Ferguson. But he’s almost as expensive as Ferguson, and a lot less durable than Ferguson. This is a trade that could bring a big benefit to the Jets, but with Clady’s injury history, it’s also a trade that carries some risk.</p>
<p>The trade also opens up cap space for Denver, and could help facilitate a trade for <a class="nameLink" href="http://www.rotoworld.com/player/nfl/6530/colin-kaepernick">Colin Kaepernick</a>.</p>
