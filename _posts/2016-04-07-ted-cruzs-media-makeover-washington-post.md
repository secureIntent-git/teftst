(Paul Sancya/Associated Press)</span> </div> <p>There was a funny moment during Ted Cruz’s televised town hall event in Madison, Wis., on Monday night when the media-bashing senator from Texas cited an unlikely source to make a point.</p> <p>“I can tell you <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtyEight</a>, who are the numbers gurus who are at the New York Times, <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/election-2016/primary-forecast/california-republican/">give me a 55 percent chance</a> of winning the state of California in their primary,” he said. (Cruz’s odds have since climbed to 61 percent, by the way.)</p> <p>It was funny because Cruz, chasing Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination, generally seems to hate the Times and gives little credence to its reporting and analysis. During a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/01/14/6th-republican-debate-transcript-annotated-who-said-what-and-what-it-meant/">debate in January</a>, he said, “The New York Times and I don’t exactly have the warmest of relationships.” It was also funny because the FiveThirtyEight blog hasn’t been hosted by the Times for almost three years. Founder Nate Silver <a href="http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/22/nate-silver-went-against-the-grain-for-some-at-the-times/">took it to ESPN in 2013</a>; its analytical content covers politics and sports.</p> <p>But, hey, give Cruz a break; he isn’t used to dignifying mainstream news outlets. It’s going to take some practice.</p> <p>But he <em>is</em> practicing. At the same event, he reminded Fox News Channel moderator Megyn Kelly that Trump once “suggested that David Pecker, the head of the National Enquirer, should be the new editor of Time magazine.”</p> <p>“I mean, how ludicrous is that?” he added, showing a bit of reverence for the publication.</p> <p>Fast-forward to Thursday, and Cruz is on Time’s cover. Headline: “Likable Enough?”</p>  <p>It’s a question ostensibly posed to Republicans — both in Washington with whom, to borrow a phrase, he <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/18/the-many-creative-ways-the-media-have-told-us-that-people-think-ted-cruz-is-a-jerk/">doesn’t exactly have the warmest of relationships</a>, and those in places like Wisconsin, who <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/wi/wisconsin_republican_presidential_primary-3763.html">seemed to favor</a> Scott Walker, then Ben Carson, then Trump before settling on Cruz in Tuesday’s primary.</p> <p>But the question could just as easily apply to the media, which earlier in the race often portrayed Cruz as an unelectable extremist but have more recently presented him as a saner alternative to the GOP front-runner.</p> <p>FiveThirtyEight (since Cruz brought it up) <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lets-be-serious-about-ted-cruz-from-the-start-hes-too-extreme-and-too-disliked-to-win/">published an article</a> under the following headline on the day he began his campaign: “Let’s Be Serious About Ted Cruz From the Start: He’s Too Extreme and Too Disliked To Win.” Here’s how it began:</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s newly minted presidential campaign is the media equivalent of a juicy rib-eye that robbers use to distract a guard dog during a heist. He’ll get a ton of media attention, and he’ll get to spread his message — which may be all that Cruz is after — but Cruz almost certainly has no shot of winning the nomination, according to every indicator that predicts success in presidential primaries.</p> <p>Now, however, FiveThirtyEight is <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/are-sanders-and-cruz-really-less-electable/">challenging the notion</a> that Cruz is too extreme to win. In <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ted-cruz-not-paul-ryan-would-probably-win-a-contested-convention/">another piece</a> this week, Silver himself predicted that Cruz “would probably win a contested convention.”</p> <p>My, how things change.</p> <p>To be clear, we’re not talking about a full-on embrace between Cruz and the media here. It’s more like an air hug offered with all the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/03/17/lindsey-graham-will-raise-money-for-ted-cruz-a-man-he-has-said-some-amazingly-bad-things-about/">enthusiasm of Sen. Lindsey Graham</a>. But the dynamic is clearly different these days for two big reasons:</p> <p>1. Cruz, a prickly character in his own right, looks positively genial next to Trump. He has become, rather improbably, a sympathetic figure as his billionaire rival insults him and his wife. A <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/us/politics/republican-primary-results.html">front-page New York Times story</a> on Wednesday that recapped Cruz’s Wisconsin victory stated that “after several days of media coverage dominated by Mr. Trump’s attacks against Mr. Cruz’s wife and shifting statements on abortion, Mr. Cruz made a play for the high road.”</p> <p>Cruz also has struck a softer, more reflective note in recent interviews. He told Kelly at the town hall meeting on Monday that, looking back on his <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sen-cruz-continues-night-long-attack-on-obamacare/2013/09/25/5ea2f6ae-25ae-11e3-b75d-5b7f66349852_story.html">2013 filibuster of the Affordable Care Act</a>, “I wish in hindsight I’d done a better job of reaching out to a lot of the key thought leaders, of looping people in on our strategy, on building a broader coalition at first.”</p> <p>2. Speaking of that 21-hour talkathon, Cruz’s insurgent bid for the GOP nomination seems much more serious and realistic than any vain stunt he pulled in the past. The media are treating him accordingly.</p> <p>Once a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ted-cruzs-phony-obamacare-filibuster-was-really-about--ted-cruz/2013/09/25/b8f273a8-2632-11e3-b3e9-d97fb087acd6_story.html">caricature</a> of conservatism known for reading “Green Eggs and Ham” on the Senate floor, Cruz today is generally regarded by journalists as a savvy campaigner who is <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2016-04-06/cruz-outmaneuvering-trump-in-hand-to-hand-gop-delegate-fight">outmaneuvering Trump</a> in the battle for delegate allegiances and executing a defensive strategy — to block Trump from reaching the magic number, 1,237 — that actually might work. If nothing else, Cruz is earning respect.</p>  <p>A year ago, when Cruz was just setting out on his presidential run, it was hard to imagine that media coverage would ever depict him as not only a real threat to win the Republican nomination but also as far more genteel and sensible than his top rival. Yet that’s exactly what has happened.</p></div><div readability="32"><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/people/callum-borchers"><img src="http://www.whenitson.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/borchersc.jpg" data-threshold="480" class="post-body-headshot-left "/></a><p>Callum Borchers covers the intersection of politics and media.</p></div>
