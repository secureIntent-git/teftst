		<p>Three people were fatally shot and two were wounded Saturday evening in an apparent murder-suicide in Panorama City, the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-panorama-city-murder-suicide-20160611-snap-story.html" target="_blank">Los Angeles Times reported</a>, citing police.</p>
<p>The shooting occurred about 7:30 p.m. inside an apartment in the 8500 block of Cedros Avenue, leaving one man and two women dead, LAPD Officer J. Kim told The Times.</p>
<p>Two other adults were hospitalized in unknown condition after being shot and injured, according to the newspaper.</p>
<p>The incident was possibly domestic-related, the Los Angeles Police Department said.</p>
<p>Investigators believe one of the deceased individuals was the shooter, Kim said, though it was unclear if that person was the man or one of the two women.</p>
