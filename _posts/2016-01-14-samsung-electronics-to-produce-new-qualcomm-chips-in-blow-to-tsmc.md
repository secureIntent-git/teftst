<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">SEOUL</span> Qualcomm Inc said on Thursday Samsung Electronics Co Ltd will become the sole manufacturer of its new flagship mobile chip, a major boost for the South Korean tech giant as it vies for deals with bigger rival TSMC.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The deal, which some analysts estimate is worth over $1 billion, comes as Samsung, a major Apple Inc supplier, is heading into another profit drop this year due to slowing demand for consumer electronics and components.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>"This is very significant because never before has Qualcomm used foundries other than TSMC to make high-end chipsets," Maybank Kim Eng analyst Warren Lau said.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Samsung could gain more than $1 billion in revenue from the Snapdragon 820 orders at its Taiwanese rival's expense, he said.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), which has counted Qualcomm as its top customer, said on Thursday it expected falling demand in high-end smartphones in the current quarter after posting a better than expected quarterly profit.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Qualcomm said in a separate e-mail statement to Reuters that Samsung was the sole manufacturer for the new Snapdragon 820 mobile processors.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Though Qualcomm's order alone will not rejuvenate Samsung's earnings, the deal suggests gathering momentum in the Korean firm's efforts to grow its foundry business to diversify its revenue stream. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>The firm is relying more on components such as chips and displays as rivals Apple and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] undercut sales and margins of the world's top smartphone maker. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>GAINING GROUND</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>TSMC dwarfs Samsung's foundry business in terms of revenue, but the two firms are competing fiercely for orders from high-end customers including Apple Inc. Samsung's 14-nanometre technology has helped the firm gain ground against TSMC and pick up new clients. </p><span id="midArticle_11"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Maybank Kim Eng's Lau said Qualcomm would likely increase orders to Samsung for other Snapdragon chips that would launch later this year, and it would be a key client once the South Korean firm started mass production based on the 10-nanometre technology under development. Qualcomm's orders could also attract more customers away from TSMC to Samsung, he said. </p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Smaller chips reduce power consumption, improve performance and lower costs by allowing more to fit on a single wafer.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Samsung said the Snapdragon 820 used its 14-nanometre manufacturing process, which it also used to make its own Exynos processors. They would be in products in the first half of the year, Samsung added in a statement, without revealing the value of the contract.  </p><span id="midArticle_14"/><span id="midArticle_15"/><p> (Reporting by Se Young Lee; Editing by Stephen Coates)</p><span id="midArticle_16"/></div>
