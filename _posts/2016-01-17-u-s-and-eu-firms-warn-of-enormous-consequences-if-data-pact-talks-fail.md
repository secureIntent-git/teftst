<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocation">BRUSSELS/WASHINGTON</span> The two largest American and European trade groups have warned of "enormous" consequences for thousands of businesses and millions of users if Brussels and Washington fail to wrap up talks on a data transfer pact by the end of the month.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The United States and Washington accelerated negotiations on a new framework enabling firms to easily transfer personal data across the Atlantic after the previous one was struck down by a top EU court last year on concerns about U.S. snooping.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Under European Union data protection law, companies cannot transfer EU citizens' personal data to countries outside the bloc deemed to have insufficient privacy safeguards, of which the United States is one.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Since the EU's highest court ruled on Oct. 6 that the 15-year-old Safe Harbour framework, used by over 4,000 firms to transfer Europeans' data to the United States, did not adequately protect the data because U.S. national security requirements trumped privacy safeguards, firms on both sides of the Atlantic have been in legal limbo.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>In a letter, seen by Reuters, to U.S. President Barack Obama, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the 28 European heads of state, four business associations warned of the dire economic impact if data flows between the two blocs were disrupted.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>"This issue must be resolved immediately or the consequences could be enormous for the thousands of businesses and millions of users impacted," the letter from U.S. Chamber of Commerce, BusinessEurope, DigitalEurope and the Information Technology Industry Council says. (<a href="http://bit.ly/1OqqMKX">bit.ly/1OqqMKX</a>)</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The groups also ask for a transition period to comply with any revised data transfer framework, especially for those small and medium-sized businesses that relied entirely on Safe Harbour.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>IMPENDING DEADLINE</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>European Union data protection authorities gave Brussels and Washington until the end of January to forge a new pact and businesses the same deadline to set up alternative legal channels to transfer personal data across the Atlantic, such as binding corporate rules within multinationals or model clauses.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>While a political agreement may be possible in that time, ironing out the legal details will take longer, according to a person familiar with the talks.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>However the business groups warn that all data transfer mechanisms are in jeopardy as a result of the EU ruling, something echoed by lawyers, and that could impact nearly all financial transactions between the two largest economies in the world.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>"We therefore urge your leadership to ensure a durable legal framework for transatlantic data flows in the future," the letter says.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>EU privacy regulators are due to meet on Feb. 2 to decide if they should start taking enforcement action against companies if they come to the conclusion that all transfer mechanisms fall foul of EU law and there is no new framework in place.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Revelations two years ago of mass U.S. surveillance programs where American authorities collected private information directly from big tech firms like Apple (<span id="symbol_AAPL.O_0">AAPL.O</span>), Facebook (<span id="symbol_FB.O_1">FB.O</span>) and Google (<span id="symbol_GOOGL.O_2">GOOGL.O</span>) riled Europe and set the stage for the European Court of Justice ruling.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><span id="midArticle_16"/><p> (Editing by Ros Russell)</p><span id="midArticle_17"/></div>
