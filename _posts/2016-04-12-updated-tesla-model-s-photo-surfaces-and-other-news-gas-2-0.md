He snapped this photo at the Melbourne Tesla store and posted it early this morning. Not only does it show the <a href="http://gas2.org/2016/04/11/updates-to-tesla-model-s-expected-this-week/#comment-2619460772" target="_blank">new front end treatment</a> for the Model S complete with LED headlights, it may show one of the new colors that will be available soon. Thanks to Raphael Sturm for alerting me to this breaking news.</p>

<p>As long as we are talking about Tesla (again), here are a few more tidbits from the past 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Deliveries in Germany Up </strong></p>
<p>Model S deliveries in Germany were up 35% in the first quarter of 2016 versus the same period last year according to <a href="http://electrek.co/2016/04/11/tesla-model-s-deliveries-germany-q1-2016/">Electrek</a>. In March, Tesla delivered 267 Model S sedans in Germany. The best month prior to that was 235 units in December of last year. Until now, Germany has not had any incentives for electric cars, but is poised to begin offering rebates of €5,000 soon, according to news reports. That can only help Tesla sales. It is already outselling the Mercedes S Class, BMW 7 Series, and Audi A8 in the German market.</p>
<p><strong>Model X recall</strong></p>
<p>As reported by <a href="http://www.teslarati.com/tesla-recalls-model-x-third-row-seats/">Teslarati</a>, Tesla will recall all of the 2,700 Model X SUV’s it has built so far to replace a latching mechanism for the third row seats. The company sent an e-mail to all Model X owners yesterday that read, “Recently, during an internal seat strength test that was conducted prior to the start of Model X deliveries in Europe, the recliner in a third row Model X seat unexpectedly slipped. The recliner, which is provided to us by an outside supplier, is the locking hinge that allows the third row seat back to fold forward, and if a recliner were to slip during a crash, the seat back could move forward.”</p>
<p>A fix is reportedly in the works and the needed repair is expected to be completed within 5 weeks. Once again, Tesla is stepping up right away to resolve an issue. That runs counter to normal practice in the auto industry, where companies typically spend years denying there is a problem and then more years fixing it. Good for Tesla.</p>
<p><strong>New Easter Egg</strong></p>
<p>Elon Musk has a sense of humor. That may come as a surprise to some of you, but he has borrowed from the movie <em>Spaceballs</em> for the name Ludicrous Mode applied to the top performance level of his cars. He also pays homage to the classic movie <em>Spinal Tap</em> by having the volume controls on Tesla cars go all the way to 11.</p>
<p>Musk likes to include an “Easter Egg” in software updates — an unexpected surprise that takes some sleuthing to figure out. The latest software update now includes a “psychedelic cowbell road.” What’s that? Watch the video to find out. Must tweeted yesterday:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" readability="10.006451612903"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Activate autopilot 4X in quick succession for psychedelic cowbell road. And, yes, we are adding more cowbell soon.</p>
<p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/719571133389938688">April 11, 2016</a></p></blockquote>
