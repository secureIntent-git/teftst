The magazine was to release its annual rankings Tuesday (April 19), and Franklin had<a href="http://www.nola.com/education/index.ssf/2015/05/best_louisiana_high_school_201.html"> moved up nationally</a> by 27 steps. It also was named the nation's 15<sup>th</sup> best charter school.</p>

<p>Both schools received gold medals, as did Patrick F. Taylor Science and Technology Academy in Westwego and <a href="http://topics.nola.com/tag/lusher/">Lusher Charter </a>in New Orleans. Only 2.5 percent of the nation's eligible high schools received this recognition, according to the magazine.</p>
