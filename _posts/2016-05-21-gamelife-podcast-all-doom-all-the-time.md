At the DICE Summit this week, I got the chance to talk with Penn Jillette, one half of Penn &amp; Teller, and Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford, following their keynote presentation. The pair are working together on a new version, with some virtual reality elements, of the classic <em>Desert Bus</em>. Their <a href="https://youtu.be/OMbU95WtZlY?t=34m30s" target="_blank">session at DICE</a> focused on how game developers can use principles of magic in their designs.<br/> <br/>After a few minutes of conversation, I realized I wanted to share the whole session with everyone. So on this episode of the Game|Life Podcast, it’s the whole interview. To call it “wide-ranging” might undersell it a bit. Here’s some of what you can expect:<br/> 
<ul><li><em>Desert Bus</em></li>
<li>Hillary Clinton</li>
<li>Janet Reno</li>
<li>Virtual Reality, Shakespeare, and politics</li>
<li><em>The Music Man</em></li>
<li>The time Penn met Notch</li>
<li>The Residents</li>
<li>Guarding magical secrets</li>
<li>The Internet as world-peace engine</li>
<li>Fake lottery tickets</li>
</ul><p> <br/>And more. I hope you enjoy this as much as I did, and thanks to Jillette and Pitchford for joining in.</p>
