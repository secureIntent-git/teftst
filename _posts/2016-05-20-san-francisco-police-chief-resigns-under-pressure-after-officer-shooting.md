"But following this morning's officer-involved shooting and my meeting with Chief Suhr this afternoon, today I have arrived at a different conclusion to the question of how best to move forward."</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>San Francisco Police spokeswoman Officer Grace Gatpandan said she could not comment on the resignation. "The statement was given by the mayor. That's all we have," she said.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Hours earlier, Suhr told reporters that around 9:45 a.m. two officers approached a 27-year-old woman as she sat in a car that had been reported as stolen. Neither the woman nor the officers have been identified. Suhr did not give the race of the officers and said he did not know whether the woman was armed.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>The woman tried to drive off, crashing into another vehicle fewer than 100 feet away. She was shot by one of the officers, a sergeant, after refusing to comply with their orders, Suhr said. She later died at an area hospital.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>

        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Thursday's shooting occurred in San Francisco's Bayview neighborhood, where in December police fatally shot a black man who was a suspect in a stabbing. Police said then that 26-year-old Mario Woods, whose family has sued the city, was holding a knife and refused to drop it.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Bystander video of that shooting, which went viral after being published online, showed Woods being shot in a hail of gunfire by officers. The city's public defender has called the shooting unnecessary.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><span id="midArticle_11"/><p> (Reporting by Curtis Skinner in San Francisco; Editing by James Dalgleish and Leslie Adler)</p><span id="midArticle_12"/></div>
