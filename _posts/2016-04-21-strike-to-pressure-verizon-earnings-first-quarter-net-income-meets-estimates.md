<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocatio&lt;/span&gt;n">Verizon Communications Inc said an ongoing strike by its wireline workers was expected to hurt earnings in the current quarter, even as it reported first-quarter net income that met analyst expectations amid strong tablet sales.</span></p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Shares of Verizon, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, were down 1.3 percent at $50.47 in late morning trading on Thursday.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>If the strike, now in its second week, continues for an extended period of time, it could pressure full-year earnings, Chief Financial Officer Fran Shammo said in an interview. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"We'd like to settle this sooner than later," Shammo said.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>About 40,000 employees of Verizon's wireline business, which includes its Fios Internet, telephone and TV services, went on strike after reaching an impasse in talks over a new labor contract. Issues include healthcare, offshoring of call center jobs, temporary job relocations and pensions.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>In the wireline business, consumer revenue of $4 billion was little changed from a year ago. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Net income attributable to the company rose to $4.31 billion, or $1.06 per share, in the first quarter, meeting analysts' expectations.   </p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>The company stood by its full-year profit forecast. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Verizon has been scaling back its Fios TV and Internet business, which represented about 29 percent of its 2015 revenue. </p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>"Rather than investing in good jobs here at home, Verizon refuses to make Fios available to thousands of people ... throughout the East Coast and is embarking on a questionable path to acquire troubled Yahoo and other companies," Brooklyn-based Verizon field technician Anthony Finocchio, said in a statement on Thursday.   </p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>To tap new revenue, the company has shifted its focus to the advertising-supported Internet business and acquired AOL last June for $4.4 billion. It is seen as the front-runner in bidding for Yahoo Inc's core Internet business.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>The company, known for its high-quality network, is locked in a battle for subscribers with competitors in the saturated U.S. wireless market. Smaller rival Sprint Corp has been offering half-off discounts, and T-Mobile US Inc has launched free music and video-streaming plans.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Verizon reported strong subscriber net additions for the first quarter ended March 31, adding 640,000 wireless retail postpaid subscribers, helped by tablet promotions during a seasonally slow period for phone upgrades. That surpassed analysts' average estimate of 480,000, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount. </p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Customer defections, or churn, in Verizon's wireless postpaid business, dropped to 0.96 percent from 1.03 percent a year earlier.   </p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Total operating revenue rose 0.6 percent to $32.17 billion, falling slightly short of analysts' average estimate of $32.46 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><span id="midArticle_16"/><p> (Reporting by Malathi Nayak in New York and Sai Sachin R in Bengaluru.
