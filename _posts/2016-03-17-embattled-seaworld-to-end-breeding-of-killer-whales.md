<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="4"><p><span class="articleLocatio&lt;/span&gt;n">Theme park operator SeaWorld said on Thursday it will stop breeding killer whales, bowing to years of pressure from animal rights activists.</span></p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>SeaWorld Entertainment Inc's (<span id="symbol_SEAS.N_0">SEAS.N</span>) decision came after it pledged in November to replace its signature "Shamu" killer whale shows in San Diego with modified presentations of the animals that focused on conservation.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>"We don’t need all these theatrical 'tricks,'” SeaWorld President Joel Manby said on a conference call with reporters. Manby said the parks will use birth control to halt reproduction among its killer whales, also known as orcas.  </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>SeaWorld, which has parks in San Diego, Orlando and San Antonio, has 29 killer whales under its care, with only five of them captured in the wild and the rest born in captivity. It has not collected orcas at sea for almost 40 years.    </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>The parks have been criticized for their treatment of the captive marine mammals, with some activists seeking an end to public exhibition of killer whales altogether.          </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>The criticism intensified after three orcas died at SeaWorld San Antonio within a six-month span in 2015. In a statement responding to the deaths, the company said: "We have the highest standard of care for all animals at our parks."          </p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>SeaWorld, whose shares rose 6 percent on Thursday, also said it will scrap plans for a $100 million project called "Blue World" to enlarge its 7-million-gallon orca habitat at SeaWorld San Diego.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Some activists have called for SeaWorld to release its orcas into coastal sanctuaries, but the company says whales born or raised in captivity would likely die in the wild.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>U.S. Representative Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California who had introduced legislation seeking to phase out the breeding and captivity of orcas, praised SeaWorld's decision. </p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>"Visitors will reward their actions with a renewed interest in the parks," Schiff wrote in an email.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Schiff's measure was one of several bills introduced as SeaWorld faced mounting criticism after the release of the 2013 documentary "Blackfish," which depicted the captivity and public exhibition of killer whales as inherently cruel.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>The documentary examined the death of trainer Dawn Brancheau, who was killed by a performing whale named Tilikum at SeaWorld Orlando in 2010. </p><span id="midArticle_12"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>"The fact that SeaWorld is doing away with orca breeding marks truly meaningful change," said Gabriela Cowperthwaite, director of "Blackfish."</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><p>Animal rights group People for Ethical Treatment of Animals said SeaWorld had taken a step forward but renewed a call for the company to link its tanks to ocean sanctuaries.     </p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Under the new plan the orcas will still be shown to visitors at set times, but viewing areas will be reconfigured to "reflect the natural world" with a program focusing on "orca enrichment, exercise and overall health," according to the SeaWorld website. </p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>SeaWorld also said it will partner with the Humane Society of the United States and had set aside $50 million to push for an end to commercial whaling and seal hunting as well as the killing of sharks for their fins over the next five years.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><span id="midArticle_1"/><p> (Reporting by Ramkumar Iyer in Bengaluru, Barbara Liston in Orlando and Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles; Editing by Ted Kerr, Sara Catania and Jeffrey Benkoe)</p><span id="midArticle_2"/></div>
