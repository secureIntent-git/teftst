<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="3"><p><span class="articleLocation">WASHINGTON</span> A revised criminal justice reform bill moved closer to a full U.S. Senate vote on Thursday when it gained support from more Republicans after being stalled for months in Congress.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>In a legacy-shaping issue for President Barack Obama, the measure's sponsors announced four new Republican co-sponsor senators and a new version of the bill at a press conference in the Senate.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>As revised, it still lowers mandatory minimum sentences for some non-violent federal drug offenders, but it no longer applies to anyone convicted of a serious violent felony.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>That change was a response to conservative critics of the bill, which is central to Obama's efforts to overhaul the country's federal criminal justice system and reduce prison overcrowding. That effort has been a rare example of Republican and Democratic agreement in the polarized Congress.  </p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The bill's advocates have said they hope the revisions and new co-sponsors, such as Republican senators Mark Kirk of Illinois and Steve Daines of Montana, will convince Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to bring up the bill for a Senate vote.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Daines and Kirk lent their support after adding minor requirements to the bill, including a provision that savings from it go toward purposes such as fighting gangs of national significance.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>After a group of conservative Republican senators led by Tom Cotton of Arkansas claimed in January that the reforms would release violent felons from federal prison, the bill’s authors began excising parts of the proposal that eased the sentences of violent criminals. </p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>To exclude violent criminals, the authors removed a section that lowered minimum sentences for unlawful gun owners with three prior convictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses, known as “armed career criminals.” </p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Such criminals represent nearly a fifth of the 12,908 current inmates who would have been eligible for resentencing under the old bill, according to the U.S. Sentencing Commission.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>A senior Republican Senate aide told Reuters the new revisions are intended to “maintain the benefit of the bargain struck in the introduced bill” by not just narrowing the bill but also expanding the population of minor offenders eligible for shorter sentences.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>The bill also now includes a new mandatory minimum sentence for crimes involving the opiate fentanyl, mirroring parallel sentencing reforms that await a floor vote in the U.S. House of Representatives.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><span id="midArticle_12"/><p> (Reporting by Julia Harte; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and James Dalgleish)</p><span id="midArticle_13"/></div>
