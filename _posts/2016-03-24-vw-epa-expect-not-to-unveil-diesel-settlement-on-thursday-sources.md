        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>One central issue is whether the EPA will accept a fix that does not completely address excess on-road emissions. EPA spokeswoman Laura Allen declined to comment on that question, or the status of the talks.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Earlier this month, a California official said the state may allow partially repaired Volkswagen diesel cars to continue operating on its roads because a full fix may be impossible.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>The cars are equipped with "defeat devices" that allow them to pass laboratory emissions tests despite exceeding federal standards by up to 40 times when they are driven on roads.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Todd Sax, chief of CARB's enforcement division, said this month he did not believe a fix was available that would allow the cars to comply with the emissions standards or the onboard diagnostic requirements.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>"We will have to decide what the best approach is to dealing with these vehicles, and one of the options potentially would be to accept something less than a full fix," he said.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>A VW spokeswoman declined to comment on the status of the talks.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Regulators could also require VW to set aside money to address excess pollution as part of a settlement.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>The U.S. Justice Department in February sued Europe's biggest automaker for up to $46 billion for violating U.S. environmental laws. VW and its Audi and Porsche brands remain barred from selling any new 2016 diesel models in the United States.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/><span id="midArticle_14"/><p> (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by David Gregorio)</p><span id="midArticle_15"/></div>
