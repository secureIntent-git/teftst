<br><div id="start-of-content"><article class="content link-underline relative body-copy" data-js="content" itemprop="articleBody" readability="46.573041637262"><p><em>On the </em>Song Exploder<em> podcast, host Hrishikesh Hirway talks to musicians who take apart their songs and, piece by piece, tell the stories of how they were made. Listen below.</em></p>
<p>Glasgow-based trio <a href="http://www.chvrch.es/">Chvrches</a> went for a much more complex sound on their second album, <em>Every Open Eye</em>. To do that the band returned to the same flat where they recorded their debut album, <em>The Bones of What You Believe</em>, and opted to put their recording budget into <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/09/chvrches/" target="_blank">upgrading their gear</a>. In this episode, they break down “Clearest Blue,” which builds walls of synths before launching into a cathartic release. Originally, the band set out to write a more subdued song with only two chords, but kept bending those rules along the way. You’ll hear the band’s original demo, which features a temporary vocal track by Martin Doherty carrying the melody before vocalist Lauren Mayberry added her lyrics. The band also talks about the glorious vocal build, which blends “percussion, melody, and sentiment” as Mayberry’s voice races to express her many thoughts as quickly as the song will carry them. “You want it to mean something, but you want it to fit percussively and melodically as well,” says Mayberry. It’s a fascinating glimpse into the creative process behind one of the best songs of 2015.</p>
