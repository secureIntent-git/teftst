<span class="focusParagraph" readability="6"><p><span class="articleLocation">BEIJING</span> Siemens (<span id="symbol_SIEGn.DE_0">SIEGn.DE</span>) has no interest in becoming a white knight for German robot maker Kuka (<span id="symbol_KU2G.DE_1">KU2G.DE</span>), which is the target of a 4.5 billion euro ($5.06 billion) takeover bid by Chinese home appliance maker Midea (<span id="symbol_000333.SZ_2">000333.SZ</span>), Siemens' chief executive said.</p></span><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>"If we had been interested, we would have acted on it some time ago," Joe Kaeser told German broadcaster ntv in an interview.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Midea's bid has fanned a furious debate over Chinese takeovers in Europe, with politicians such as German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel calling for tougher restrictions. It has also prompted Berlin to consider whether Kuka's technology is crucial for the digitalisation of German industry, an economic priority. </p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>Kaeser, speaking to the broadcaster on the sidelines of Chancellor Angela Merkel's trade visit to Beijing, said he believed Gabriel, who is also Vice Chancellor, was relaxed about Kuka's situation.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>"I don't believe that Mr Gabriel has a concern," Kaeser said. </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>"As Economy Minister, he's looking out for his country... in that sense, it's quite natural that he should look at alternatives," Kaeser added.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>Gabriel said earlier this month there was an effort under way to develop an alternative offer for Kuka.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily reported that Gabriel had spoken to German car manufacturers and Siemens about mounting a possible counter-bid for Kuka. But sources close to the government and Siemens told Reuters the idea had met with little enthusiasm.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Andy Gu, vice chief executive of Midea, told Germany's Handelsblatt newspaper that his company's bid for Kuka was motivated by business interests and aimed at helping the German company target the huge Chinese market. It was a not a political undertaking, he said.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>"We are a private company. It's not important to us what the Chinese government demands," the newspaper quoted Gu as saying.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Gu said Kuka would remain independent, adding that he expected Chinese authorities to approve the takeover, according to the newspaper.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
