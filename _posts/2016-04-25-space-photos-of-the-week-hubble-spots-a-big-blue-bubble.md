									<span class="marg-r-micro">Just in time for the 26th anniversary of Hubble's launch on April 24, 1990, the telescope has photographed an enormous, balloon-like bubble being blown into space by a super-hot, massive star. Astronomers trained the iconic telescope on this colorful feature, called the Bubble Nebula, or NGC 7635. The bubble is 7 light-years across â€” about one-and-a-half times the distance from our sun to its nearest stellar neighbor, Alpha Centauri.</span><span class="credit"><span aria-hidden="true" role="presentation" class="ui ui-photo inline-block ui-credit relative opacity-6 marg-l-sm "/><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/hubble-sees-a-star-inflating-a-giant-bubble"> NASA, ESA, and the Hubble Heritage Team</a></span>								</p>
