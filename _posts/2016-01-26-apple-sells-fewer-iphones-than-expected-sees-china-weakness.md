<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">SAN FRANCISCO</span> Apple Inc (<span id="symbol_AAPL.O_0">AAPL.O</span>) forecast its first revenue drop in 13 years and reported the slowest-ever growth in iPhone shipments as the critical Chinese market showed signs of weakening, suggesting the technology company's period of exponential growth may be ending.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>The company's shares, which have fallen 5 percent this year, bounced around in after-hours trading and were down 0.7 percent as a call with analysts was underway.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>"It's disappointing to see them miss on an already downward adjusted sales number and the fact is that with their iPhone growth slowing what was needed was a product to be excited about," said J.J. Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade. "Pressure on the shares will continue without a well-defined plan to grow sales or a new product."</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>The most valuable publicly traded U.S. tech company said on Tuesday it sold 74.8 million iPhones in its fiscal first quarter, ended Dec. 26, the first full quarter of sales of the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. The 0.4 percent growth in shipments was the lowest since the product was launched in 2007.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>IPhone sales were expected to fall for the current quarter over a year ago, Chief Executive Tim Cook said on a conference call with analysts. </p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>While revenue in Greater China rose 14 percent in the last quarter, Apple is beginning to see a shift in the economy, particularly in Hong Kong, Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters in an interview.</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>"As we move into the March quarter it's becoming more apparent that there are some signs of economic softness," Maestri said. "We are starting to see something that we have not seen before."</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>Apple forecast second-quarter revenue of $50 billion to $53 billion, below analysts' average forecast of $55.5 billion. In the same quarter last year Apple reported revenue of $58 billion.</p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>Apple's guidance for the March quarter implies iPhone sales of 45 to 50 million units in the March quarter, which would mark the company's first-ever decline in sales of the gadget, said analyst Daniel Ives of FBR Capital Markets &amp; Co.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>In the same quarter last year Apple sold 61.2 million iPhones.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>The company reported revenue of $18.37 billion from Greater China, accounting for 24.2 percent of total revenue. Revenue from the region had nearly doubled in the fourth quarter.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Apple's iPhone shipments fell short of analyst expectations for 75.5 million, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Apple reported earnings of  $3.28 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $3.23 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue increased 1.7 percent to $75.87 billion, both records for the company.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Analysts had expected revenue of $76.54 billion.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Apple's overall performance was "slightly better than feared," said Ives at FBR.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><p>The rise in iPhone shipments in the key holiday shopping quarter was the smallest since the second fiscal quarter of 2013, when they rose 6.8 percent, according to data company Statista.</p><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>Maestri attributed the lackluster revenue to foreign exchange headwinds caused by the strong U.S. dollar, which he said knocked about $5 billion off the company's revenue.</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><span id="midArticle_2"/><p> (Additional reporting by Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru; Editing by Stephen R.
