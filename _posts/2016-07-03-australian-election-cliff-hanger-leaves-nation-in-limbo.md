Instead it has left a power vacuum in Canberra and fueled talk of a challenge to Turnbull's leadership of the Liberal Party, less than a year after he ousted then prime minister Tony Abbott in a party-room coup. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/><p>If the coalition fails to form a government, it would be the first time in 85 years an Australian ruling party has lost power after its first term in office.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>The uncertainty is likely to spook markets when they reopen on Monday, with analysts warning Australia's triple A credit rating could be at risk and predicting a fall in the Australian dollar and the share market.</p><span id="midArticle_10"/><p>Vote counting could take a week or more, and the coalition will rule under caretaker provisions in the interim.</p><span id="midArticle_11"/><p>Official electoral data for the House of Representatives showed a 3.4 percent swing away from the government, with about two-thirds of votes counted.</p><span id="midArticle_12"/><p>Electoral Commission projections give the coalition 67 seats in the 150-seat lower house, against Labor's 71 and five to independents and the Greens Party. A further seven seats were in the balance.</p><span id="midArticle_13"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>That leaves independents, whose election campaigns ranged from economic protectionism to anti-gambling and policies to improve the treatment of asylum seekers, as kingmakers.</p><span id="midArticle_14"/><p>Small parties are likely to hold the balance of power in the Senate, with Pauline Hanson's One Nation on track to win between two and four seats, marking the return of the anti-immigration activist to parliament after an almost 20-year absence.</p><span id="midArticle_15"/><span id="midArticle_0"/><p>LEADERSHIP DOUBTS</p><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Confirming that talks were already underway, independent member of parliament Andrew Wilkie said Turnbull had called him just to "open lines of communication".</p><span id="midArticle_2"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Stirling Griff, a Nick Xenophon Team candidate who is on track to win a senate seat, said the party was scrambling to pull together its wishlist for negotiations after being caught off-guard by the coalition's poor performance. </p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>Speculation has also begun about the ability of Shorten and Turnbull to hold onto the leadership of their parties. </p><span id="midArticle_4"/><p>Turnbull was under the most pressure, having ousted Abbott on a promise of stability and then called the election in a risky bid to sweep out independents in the upper house who were blocking his economic agenda.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>Turnbull had some of the highest poll ratings of an Australian leader on record shortly after he snatched the top job from Abbott in September. </p><span id="midArticle_6"/><p>But that popularity soured as he appeared to bend his center-right values on issues like climate change and same sex marriage under pressure from the right of his party.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><span id="midArticle_8"/><span id="midArticle_9"/><p> (Additional reporting by Matt Siegel.
