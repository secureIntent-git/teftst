<br><div id="start-of-content"><article class="content link-underline relative body-copy" data-js="content" itemprop="articleBody" readability="51.376623376623"><p>As they do every year, developers will soon gather at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/">WWDC</a> in San Francisco to hear the latest software announcements from <a href="http://www.wired.com/tag/apple/">Apple</a>, watch a Jony Ive-narrated video, and marvel at Craig Federighi’s impeccable hair. Mark your Calendar app for June 13 at 1 pm ET/10 am PT. And then download <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical-iphone">Fantastical 2</a>, you’ll be much happier.</p>
<p>In addition to a preview of all things iOS X—including, hopefully, a few Siri improvements, like third-party integration—and a look at the next version of OS X—which might be renamed Mac OS—you can expect to see an Apple Music overhaul, some Apple Watch progress, and maybe (finally?) a little progress on HomeKit, Apple’s mostly dormant smart home hub. </p>
<p>Beyond that, who knows? Apple invites have historically included an illustration that tips what the event’s main focus will be, but this year it’s just a plain ol’ email. Maybe good design really is invisible.</p>
<p>We’ll be covering live, as always, so check back in for both real-time updates and analysis after.</p>
