<span id="midArticle_0"/><span class="focusParagraph" readability="5"><p><span class="articleLocation">CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</span> The return of NASA astronaut Scott Kelly from the longest U.S. space mission on record will kick off a wave of medical tests and experiments intended to pave the way for extended human missions to Mars.</p></span><span id="midArticle_1"/><p>Kelly, 52, is scheduled to give a news conference at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston on Friday to discuss his 340-day mission aboard the International Space Station.</p><span id="midArticle_2"/><p>He left the station on Tuesday in a Russian Soyuz capsule, landed in Kazakhstan, then headed home to Houston.</p><span id="midArticle_3"/><p>“I’m used to going 17,500 miles per hour, but this airplane doesn’t quite do that,” Kelly quipped after a belated 2:30 a.m. EST/0730 GMT touchdown on Thursday at Ellington Field near the Johnson Space Center.</p><span id="midArticle_4"/>
        
        <span class="first-article-divide"/><p>He was welcomed by a crowd that included Jill Biden, wife of Vice President Joe Biden, who gave him beer and apple pie.</p><span id="midArticle_5"/><p>“Welcome back to Earth,” President Barack Obama wrote to Kelly on Twitter. “Your year in space is vital to the future of American space travel. Hope gravity isn't a drag!”</p><span id="midArticle_6"/>
        
        <span class="second-article-divide"/><p>Kelly is undergoing initial medical checks at the space center as he starts recovering from his time in the weightless and high-radiation environment of space.</p><span id="midArticle_7"/><p>He and Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko served about twice as long as previous crews as part of a pilot program to help NASA and its partners prepare for eventual human missions to Mars that will last at least two years. </p><span id="midArticle_8"/>
        
        <span class="third-article-divide"/><p>Scientists are studying how the human body fares during longer stays in space. Before landing, Kelly told reporters he had experienced some changes in his vision, a relatively newly discovered affliction that affects about half of astronauts on long-duration space missions.</p><span id="midArticle_9"/><p>Kelly's participation in the mission also gave doctors an opportunity to look at possible genetic changes from spaceflight. Researchers have been studying whether he and his identical twin brother, former astronaut Mark Kelly, are as genetically similar now as they were before Scott Kelly’s launch in March 2015. </p><span id="midArticle_10"/><span id="midArticle_11"/><p> (Editing by Colleen Jenkins)</p><span id="midArticle_12"/></div>
