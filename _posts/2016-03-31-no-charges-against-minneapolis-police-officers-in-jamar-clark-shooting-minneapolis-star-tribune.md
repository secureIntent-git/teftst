Leaders of the Minneapolis NAACP, Black Lives Matter and other advocates peppered Freeman with questions during the news conference, arguing the evidence points to the officers as the aggressors in the situation. They said the Nov. 15 shooting — which prompted an 18-day encampment at the city’s Fourth Police Precinct and attracted international attention — and the lack of charges for the officers involved are proof of a fractured relationship between police and the city’s black residents.</p>
